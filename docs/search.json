    "text": "3 Water System Boundaries (Target Data)\nIn this section, we’ll get the service area boundaries for Community Water Systems within the Sacramento County area. This will serve as the ‘target’ dataset – i.e., the set of areas which we’ll be estimating the characteristics of. We’ll also get a dataset of county boundaries which overlap the water service areas in this study, which will help with accessing the census data and with making maps/visualizations.\n\n3.1 Read Water System Data\nIn this case, we’ll get the water system dataset from a shapefile that’s saved locally, then transform that dataset into a common coordinate reference system for mapping and analysis (which is defined above in the variable crs_projected).\nThis water system dataset is a subset of the California Drinking Water System Area Boundaries dataset. I created the subset used here by filtering the full dataset for systems within Sacramento County (by selecting records where the COUNTY field is “SACRAMENTO”) and filtering for Community Water Systems (by selecting records where the STATE_CLAS field is “COMMUNITY”). I also dropped some un-needed fields from the dataset and reordered some columns.\n\nwater_systems_sac &lt;- st_read(here('01_data_input', \n                                  'water_supplier_boundaries_sac', \n                                  'System_Area_Boundary_Layer_Sac.shp')) %&gt;% \n    st_transform(crs_projected) # transform to common coordinate system\n\nAs an alternative, the code chunk below shows how to download this data directly from the online source dataset and apply the filters needed to reproduce the dataset in the System_Area_Boundary_Layer_Sac.shp file, using the arcgislayers package (Parry 2023). Note that the field names are different in the source dataset because they’re automatically truncated when saving to shapefile format, so the code below renames them to be consistent with dataset read above. This code is commented out (with the # symbol), since it gives the same dataset as is contained in the shapefile that’s read in above, but is included here as a reference for a more direct alternative way to obtain the current version of the target dataset.\n\n# # load arcgislayers package (see: https://r.esri.com/arcgislayers/index.html)\n# # install.packages('pak') # only needed if the pak package is not already installed\n# # pak::pkg_install(\"R-ArcGIS/arcgislayers\", dependencies = TRUE)\n# library(arcgislayers)\n# \n# # define link to data source\n# url_feature &lt;- 'https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portalserver/rest/services/Drinking_Water/California_Drinking_Water_System_Area_Boundaries/FeatureServer/0'\n# \n# # connect to data source\n# water_systems_feature_layer &lt;- arc_open(url_feature)\n# \n# # download and filter data from source\n# water_systems_sac &lt;- arc_select(\n#   water_systems_feature_layer, \n#   # apply filters\n#   where = \"COUNTY = 'SACRAMENTO' AND STATE_CLASSIFICATION = 'COMMUNITY'\",\n#   # select fields\n#   fields = c('WATER_SYSTEM_NAME', 'WATER_SYSTEM_NUMBER', 'GLOBALID', \n#              'BOUNDARY_TYPE', 'OWNER_TYPE_CODE', 'COUNTY', \n#              'REGULATING_AGENCY', 'FEDERAL_CLASSIFICATION', 'STATE_CLASSIFICATION',\n#              'SERVICE_CONNECTIONS', 'POPULATION')) %&gt;% \n#     # transform to commont coordinate system\n#     st_transform(crs_projected) %&gt;% \n#     # rename fields to match names from the shapefile\n#     rename(WATER_SY_1 = WATER_SYSTEM_NAME, \n#            WATER_SYST = WATER_SYSTEM_NUMBER,\n#            BOUNDARY_T = BOUNDARY_TYPE,\n#            OWNER_TYPE = OWNER_TYPE_CODE,\n#            REGULATING = REGULATING_AGENCY,\n#            FEDERAL_CL = FEDERAL_CLASSIFICATION,\n#            STATE_CLAS = STATE_CLASSIFICATION,\n#            SERVICE_CO = SERVICE_CONNECTIONS)\n\nWe can use the glimpse function (below) to take get a sense of what type of information is available in the water system dataset and how it’s structured.\nNote that this dataset already includes a POPULATION variable that indicates the population served by each water system. However, for this analysis we’ll be making our own estimate of the population within each system’s service area based on U.S. Census Bureau data and the spatial representation of the system boundaries. I don’t know exactly how the POPULATION variable was derived in this dataset, and it likely will not exactly match the population estimates from this analysis, but may serve as a useful check to make sure our estimates are reasonable.\n\nglimpse(water_systems_sac)\n\nRows: 62\nColumns: 12\n$ WATER_SY_1 &lt;chr&gt; \"HOOD WATER MAINTENCE DIST [SWS]\", \"MC CLELLAN MHP\", \"MAGNO…\n$ WATER_SYST &lt;chr&gt; \"CA3400101\", \"CA3400179\", \"CA3400130\", \"CA3400135\", \"CA3400…\n$ GLOBALID   &lt;chr&gt; \"{36268DB3-9DB2-4305-A85A-2C3A85F20F34}\", \"{E3BF3C3E-D516-4…\n$ BOUNDARY_T &lt;chr&gt; \"Water Service Area\", \"Water Service Area\", \"Water Service …\n$ OWNER_TYPE &lt;chr&gt; \"L\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\",…\n$ COUNTY     &lt;chr&gt; \"SACRAMENTO\", \"SACRAMENTO\", \"SACRAMENTO\", \"SACRAMENTO\", \"SA…\n$ REGULATING &lt;chr&gt; \"LPA64 - SACRAMENTO COUNTY\", \"LPA64 - SACRAMENTO COUNTY\", \"…\n$ FEDERAL_CL &lt;chr&gt; \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUN…\n$ STATE_CLAS &lt;chr&gt; \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUN…\n$ SERVICE_CO &lt;dbl&gt; 82, 199, 34, 64, 128, 83, 28, 50, 164, 5684, 14798, 115, 33…\n$ POPULATION &lt;dbl&gt; 100, 700, 40, 150, 256, 150, 32, 100, 350, 18005, 44928, 20…\n$ geometry   &lt;MULTIPOLYGON [m]&gt; MULTIPOLYGON (((-132703 403..., MULTIPOLYGON (…\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Get County Boundaries\nTo determine what data to pull from the U.S. Census Bureau, and to create some maps later, we need to get a dataset of county boundaries.

    "section": "4 Census Data (Source Data)",
    "text": "4 Census Data (Source Data)\nThis section provides some brief background on the various types of data available from the U.S. Census Bureau, and demonstrates how to retrieve data from the U.S. Census Bureau using the tidycensus R package. Most of the information covered here comes from the book Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R, which is a great source of information if you’d like more detail about any of the topics below (Walker 2023).\n\n4.1 Census Data Overview\nDifferent census products/surveys contain data on different variables, at different geographic scales, over varying periods of time, and with varying levels of certainty. Therefore, there are a number of judgement calls to make when determining which type of census data to use for an analysis – e.g., which data product to use (Decennial Census or American Community Survey), which geographic scale to use (e.g., Block, Block Group, Tract, etc.), what time frame to use, which variables to assess, etc.\nMore detailed information about U.S. Census Bureau’s data products and other topics mentioned below is available here.\n\n4.1.1 Census Geography / Hierarchy\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau is aggregated to census units which are available at different geographic scales. Some of these units are nested and can be neatly aggregated (e.g., each census tract is composed of a collection of block groups, and each block group is composed of a collection of blocks), while other census units are outside this hierarchy (e.g., Zip Code Tabulation Areas don’t coincide with any other census unit). Figure 2 shows the relationship of all of the various census units.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Census Unit Hierarchies\n\n\nFor a list of the different geographic units available for each of the different census products/surveys (see Section 4.1.2) that can be accessed via the tidycensus package, go here.\n\n\n4.1.2 Census Datasets / Surveys\nThe Decennial Census is conducted every 10 years, and is intended to provide a complete count of the US population and assist with political redistricting. As a result, it collects a relatively limited set of basic demographic data, but (should) provide a high degree of precision (i.e., in general it should provide exact counts). It is available for geographic units down to the census block (the smallest census unit available – see Section 4.1.1). For information about existing and planned future releases of 2020 census data products, go here.\nThe American Community Survey (ACS) provides a much larger array of demographic information than the Decennial Census, and is updated more frequently. The ACS is based on a sample of the population (rather than a count of the entire population, as in the Decennial Census), so it represents estimated values rather than precise counts, therefore each data point is available as an estimate (typically labeled with an ‘E’ in census variable codes, which are discussed in Section 4.1.3 ) along with an associated margin of error (typically labeled with ‘MOE’ in census variable codes) around its estimated value.\nThe ACS is available in two formats. The 5-year ACS is a rolling average of 5 years of data (e.g., the 2021 5-year ACS dataset is an average of the ACS data from 2017 through 2021), and is generally available for geographic units down to the census block group (though some 5-year ACS data may only be available at less granular levels). The 1-year ACS provides data for a single year, and is only available for geographies with population greater than 65,000 (e.g., large cities and counties). Therefore, only the 5-year ACS will be useful for any analysis at a relatively fine scale (e.g., anything that requires data at or more detailed than the census tract level, or any analysis that considers smaller counties/cities – by definition, census tracts always contain significantly fewer than 65,000 people).\nIn addition to the Decennial Census and ACS data, a number of other census data products/surveys are also available. For example, see the censusapi R package (here or here) for access to over 300 census API endpoints. For historical census data, see the discussion here on using NHGIS, IPUMS, and the ipumsr package.\n\n\n4.1.3 Census Variables / Codes\nEach census product collects data for many different demographic variables, and each variable is generally associated with an identifier code. In order to access census data programmatically, you often need to know the code associated with each variable of interest. When determining which variables to use, you need to consider what census product contains those variables (see Section 4.1.2) and how they differ in terms of time frame, precision, spatial granularity (see Section 4.1.1), etc.\nThe tidycensus package offers a convenient generic way to search for variables across different census products using the load_variables() function, as described here.\nThe following websites may also be helpful for exploring the various census data products and finding the variable names and codes they contain:\n\nCensus Reporter (for ACS data): https://censusreporter.org/ (especially https://censusreporter.org/topics/table-codes/)\nCensus Bureau’s list of variable codes, e.g.:\n\n2020 Census codes: https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/pl/variables.html\n2021 ACS 5 year codes: https://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs5/variables.html\n\nCensus Bureau’s data interface (for Decennial Census and ACS, and other census datasets): https://data.census.gov/cedsci/\nNational Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) (for ACS data and historical decennial Census data): https://www.nhgis.org/\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Accessing Census Data\nThe following sections demonstrate how to retrieve census data from the Decennial Census and the ACS using the tidycensus R package.\nIn order to use the tidycensus R package, you’ll need to obtain a personal API from the US Census Bureau (which is free and available to anyone) by signing up here: http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html. Once you have your API key, you’ll need to register it in R by entering the command census_api_key(key = \"YOUR API KEY\", install = TRUE) in the console. Note that the install = TRUE argument means that the key is saved for all future R sessions, so you’ll only need to run that command once on your computer (rather than including it in your scripts). Alternatively, you could save your key to an environment variable and retrieve it using Sys.getenv() (to avoid entering your key into any scripts that could potentially be shared).\n\n4.2.1 Decennial Census\nThis section retrieves census data from the 2020 U.S. Decennial Census, using the get_decennial function from the tidycensus package. For this example we’re getting data at the ‘Block Group’ level (with the geography = 'block group' argument), for the counties defined above in the counties_list variable (with the county = counties_list argument). By setting the geometry = TRUE argument we’ll be able to get the spatial data – i.e., the boundaries of the census block groups – along with the tabular data defined in the variables argument (see Section 4.1.3 for information about how to find variable codes). Also, while by default the tidycensus package returns data in long/tidy format, we’re getting the data in wide format for this example (by specifying output = 'wide') because it’ll be easier to work with for the method described below to estimate demographics for non-census geographies.\nNote that, to the extent possible, using census data at the most granular spatial level should provide the best results when estimating demographics for areas whose boundaries don’t align with census unit boundaries. However, depending on the use case, it may require too much time and computational resources to use the most granular spatial data, and may not be necessary to obtain a reasonable estimate. As noted above, in general the most granular level of Decennial Census data available is at the ‘Block’ level (though Decennial Census data may not be available for all data types at the block level, due to data privacy issues), but this example gets data at the ‘Block Group’ level for speed and simplicity. Data at the ‘Block’ level may be a better choice for a real-world analysis if possible.\nAlso, as a side note, tidycensus returns the Census Bureau’s cartographic boundary shapefiles by default (as opposed to the core TIGER/Line shapefiles). Those default cartographic boundary shapefiles are pre-clipped to the US coastline, and are smaller/faster to process (alternatively you can use cb = FALSE to get the TIGER/Line data) (see here). So the default spatial data returned by tidycensus may be somewhat different than the default spatial data returned by the tigris package, but in general I find it’s best to use the default tidycensus spatial data.\n\n# get census data\ncensus_data_decennial &lt;- get_decennial(geography = 'block group', # can be 'block', 'block group', 'tract', 'county', etc.\n                                       state = 'CA', \n                                       county = counties_list,\n                                       year = 2020,\n                                       variables = c(\n                                           'pop_hispanic_or_latino' = 'P2_002N', # Total Hispanic or Latino\n                                           'pop_white' = 'P2_005N', # White (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'pop_black_or_african_american' = 'P2_006N', # Black or African American (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'pop_native_american_or_alaska_native' = 'P2_007N', # American Indian and Alaska Native (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'pop_asian' = 'P2_008N', # Asian (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'pop_pacific_islander' = 'P2_009N', # Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'pop_other' = 'P2_010N', # Some other race (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'pop_multiple' = 'P2_011N', # Two or more races (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'pop_total' = 'P2_001N'\n                                       ),\n                                       output = 'wide', # can be 'wide' or 'tidy'\n                                       geometry = TRUE) \n\nThe output is an sf object (i.e., a dataframe-like object that also includes spatial data), in wide format, where each row represents a census unit, and the population of each racial/ethnic group is reported in a separate column.

    "text": "5 Compute Water System Demographics\nNow we can perform the calculations to estimate demographic characteristics for our target areas (water system service boundaries in the Sacramento County area) from our source demographic dataset (the census data we obtained above). For this example, we’ll use the 2021 5-year ACS data that we retrieved above (which is saved in the census_data_acs variable) as our source of demographic data, and we’ll estimate the following for each water system’s service area:\n\nPopulation of each racial/ethnic group (using the racial/ethnic categories defined in the census dataset), and each racial/ethnic group’s portion of the total service area population\nMedian household income\n\nThere are multiple ways this estimation can be done, but one of the most simple and straightforward is using an areal interpolation (essentially an area weighted average). The major simplifying assumption of this approach is that the population or other characteristic(s) of interest are evenly distributed within each unit in the source data – e.g., in this case we’re assuming that population (including the total population and the population of each racial/ethic group) and household income is evenly distributed within each census block group.\n\n5.1 Prepare Census Data\nTo calculate demographics for the target areas, we need to prepare the census data. First, we need to transform the 2021 5-year ACS dataset into the common projected coordinate reference system defined above.\n\n# transform to common coordinate reference system\ncensus_data_acs &lt;- census_data_acs %&gt;% \n    st_transform(crs_projected)\n\nWe can then apply some transformations to the 2021 5-year ACS dataset prior to performing the areal interpolation to simplify the results and speed the computation.\nThis isn’t strictly necessary, but we can simplify the census dataset by filtering for census units that overlap with one of the water systems in our dataset.\n\ncensus_data_filter &lt;- census_data_acs %&gt;% \n    st_filter(water_systems_sac, \n              .predicate = st_intersects)\n\nWe can also drop census units with zero population, since they won’t contribute anything to our calculations.\n\n## drop census units with zero population\ncensus_data_filter &lt;- census_data_filter %&gt;% \n    filter(pop_total &gt; 0)\n\nYou may also want to transform the census data in other ways. For example, we can combine the ‘other’ and ‘multiple’ racial/ethnic groupings into one ‘other or multiple’ racial/ethnic group.\n\n## combine other and multiple\ncensus_data_filter &lt;- census_data_filter %&gt;% \n    mutate('pop_other_or_multiple' = pop_other + pop_multiple, \n           .before = med_hh_income) %&gt;% \n    select(-c(pop_other, pop_multiple))\n\nHere’s a view of the contents and structure of the transformed census dataset:\n\nglimpse(census_data_filter)\n\nRows: 1,048\nColumns: 12\n$ GEOID                                &lt;chr&gt; \"060670031013\", \"060670050042\", \"…\n$ NAME                                 &lt;chr&gt; \"Block Group 3, Census Tract 31.0…\n$ pop_total                            &lt;dbl&gt; 966, 1569, 1989, 2865, 1398, 1641…\n$ pop_hispanic_or_latino               &lt;dbl&gt; 566, 150, 764, 893, 96, 356, 280,…\n$ pop_white                            &lt;dbl&gt; 285, 93, 826, 333, 1031, 986, 118…\n$ pop_black_or_african_american        &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 131, 214, 328, 76, 48, 123, 24…\n$ pop_native_american_or_alaska_native &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 9, 0, 20, 0, 19, 9, 0, 0, 0…\n$ pop_asian                            &lt;dbl&gt; 69, 880, 98, 1028, 32, 180, 34, 2…\n$ pop_pacific_islander                 &lt;dbl&gt; 20, 283, 0, 236, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ pop_other_or_multiple                &lt;dbl&gt; 26, 32, 78, 47, 143, 71, 84, 27, …\n$ med_hh_income                        &lt;dbl&gt; 59375, 90915, 33952, 56023, 61806…\n$ geometry                             &lt;MULTIPOLYGON [m]&gt; MULTIPOLYGON (((-123…\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Areal Interpolation\nThere are a couple of ways to implement the areal interpolation method. The example below uses the aw_interpolate function from the areal R package. The sf package’s st_interpolate_aw function provides similar functionality. It’s also possible to ‘manually’ implement the process using lower level functions from the sf package, which can be useful for even more control, but is more complicated to implement (see Section 5.5 below for examples of ‘manual’ calculations that demonstrate how the interpolation function works and provide a check on the results).\nNote that there are some settings that you may need to modify in the aw_interpolate function depending on the type of analysis you’re doing. In particular, for more information about extensive versus intensive interpolations, see this section of the documenation.

That’s because the median household income for is missing for some of the census block groups we retrieved above (a total of 43 of the overlapping census block groups from the 2021 5-year ACS dataset are missing median household income data).\nAs a workaround, we can re-calculate the median household income for water system service areas using only the census block groups that have median household income data (i.e., drop census block groups where the median household income is NA for this calculation). Note that simply removing census units with missing data could impact the quality of our calculations if there are significant portions of a service area covered by census units that contain missing values for this variable, and in a real-world analysis it may be necessary to do additional work to investigate and make adjustments to account for these missing values.

But, there may also be some cases where the numbers differ significantly – depending on the actual analysis being performed, this may mean that further work is needed for certain areas, or could mean that this method may not be sufficient and different methods are needed.\nFor water systems with a small population and/or service area, the estimated demographics may not match the population numbers in the original water system dataset very well. You can see this in Table 3 by comparing the POPULATION field, which contains the total population values from the water supplier dataset, with the pop_est_total field, which contains the total population estimated from the census data; the difference between the two is summarized in the pop_pct_difference field. This probably indicates that, for small areas, some adjustments and/or further analysis may be needed, and the preliminary estimated values should be treated with some caution/skepticism.\nNote: See Section 5.5.3 below for some initial investigation into water systems whose estimated population is zero.\n\nwater_systems_sac_demographics %&gt;% \n    arrange(POPULATION) %&gt;% \n    slice(1:10) %&gt;% \n    select(WATER_SY_1, POPULATION, pop_est_total, pop_pct_difference) %&gt;% \n    st_drop_geometry() %&gt;% \n    kable()\n\n\n\nTable 3: 10 Smallest Water Systems by Population\n\n\nWATER_SY_1\nPOPULATION\npop_est_total\npop_pct_difference\n\n\n\n\nDELTA CROSSING MHP\n30\n0\n-100.00\n\n\nLAGUNA VILLAGE RV PARK\n32\n21\n-34.38\n\n\nLINCOLN CHAN-HOME RANCH\n33\n6\n-81.82\n\n\nMAGNOLIA MUTUAL WATER\n40\n1\n-97.50\n\n\nEDGEWATER MOBILE HOME PARK\n40\n0\n-100.00\n\n\nFREEPORT MARINA\n42\n2\n-95.24\n\n\nTUNNEL TRAILER PARK\n44\n0\n-100.00\n\n\nPLANTATION MOBILE HOME PARK\n44\n11\n-75.00\n\n\nSEQUOIA WATER ASSOC\n54\n0\n-100.00\n\n\nHAPPY HARBOR (SWS)\n60\n0\n-100.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for larger water systems, the estimated population values seem to be more in line with the population numbers in the original dataset.

The results can be saved in tabular (e.g., csv, excel) and/or spatial (e.g., shapefile, geopackage) formats, which may be helpful for different use cases. Note that you may need to think about exactly what variables to include in the output file(s) and how to format the output datasets (e.g., wide versus long format).\n\n5.4.1 Tabular Dataset\nThe code below saves the tabular results to a csv file – note that this dataset is in the ‘wide’ format we originally produced the results in:\n\nwrite_csv(water_systems_sac_demographics %&gt;% \n              st_drop_geometry(), # drop the spatial data since this is a tabular format\n          file = here('02_data_results',\n                      'water_system_demographics_sac.csv'))\n\nFor the tabular data, it might be useful to save the data in the long/tidy format we developed above when making plots:\n\nwrite_csv(water_systems_sac_demographics_long %&gt;% \n              st_drop_geometry(), # drop the spatial data since this is a tabular format\n          file = here('02_data_results',\n                      'water_system_demographics_sac_long.csv'))\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Spatial Dataset\nTo save the output in a geospatial format, it may be best to save the data in a wide format, so that all of the attribute data for each target area (water system) is in a single row along with its spatial data (i.e. the system boundary information). The code below saves the results – in wide format – to a geopackage file, which is a spatial file format that is similar to a shapefile:\n\nst_write(water_systems_sac_demographics, \n         here('02_data_results',\n              'water_system_demographics_sac.gpkg'), \n         append = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Check – Manual Calculations\nTo check the interpolation obtained from the aw_interpolate function and demonstrate how it works, we can ‘manually’ perform the same types of weighted average calculation using lower level functions from the sf package. In this case, to keep the operations relatively simple, we’ll just perform the calculation for an individual water system, then check that calculated value against the results obtained from the aw_interpolate function. However, the process is the similar for the other suppliers used in this example.\n\n# pick a system to check\nsystem_check &lt;- 'CARMICHAEL WATER DISTRICT'\n\n\n5.5.1 Total Population\n\n# get the total estimated population for this supplier from above\npop_weighted_interp &lt;- water_systems_sac_demographics %&gt;% \n    filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_check) %&gt;% \n    pull(pop_est_total)\n\nIn this case, we’ll check the calculation for the water system: CARMICHAEL WATER DISTRICT. The estimated population for this system using the areal interpolation above (Section 5.2) was: 39,321.\nTo perform the ‘manual’ calculation, we’ll first get the portions of the census units that intersect the target water system’s service area. They are shown in red in Figure 10 below (the water system boundary is shown in black, and all census units which overlap the system are shown with a randomly chosen fill color).\n\n# get portion of census units that intersect the system area ----\ninterpolate_manual_pop &lt;- st_intersection(census_data_acs %&gt;% \n                                              mutate(total_area = st_area(.)), \n                                          water_systems_sac %&gt;%\n                                              filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_check))\n\n# make a plot to check the intersection\n## plot census units that overlap the system area\nplot_manual_check &lt;- ggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data = census_data_acs %&gt;% \n                st_filter(water_systems_sac %&gt;%\n                              filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_check)),\n            aes(fill = GEOID, alpha = 0.8),\n            # fill = alpha('blue', 0.8),\n            color = 'grey', \n            linewidth = 0.5,\n            show.legend = FALSE) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = unname(pal)) +\n    geom_sf(data = water_systems_sac %&gt;%\n                filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_check),\n            fill = NA,\n            color = alpha('black', 1),\n            linewidth = 2) +\n    geom_sf(data = interpolate_manual_pop,\n            fill = NA,\n            color = 'red',\n            linewidth = 0.5) + \n    theme_void()\n\n# show the plot\nplot_manual_check\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Portions of census units (red) intersecting the water system service area (black).\n\n\n\n\nThen we’ll estimate the population within each of those intersecting portions of the census units by computing an area weighted population. The area weighted population is computed by multiplying the total population of the census unit by the percent of that census unit’s area that overlaps the water supplier’s service area.\n\ninterpolate_manual_pop &lt;- interpolate_manual_pop %&gt;% \n    mutate(intersect_area = st_area(.)) %&gt;% \n    mutate(weight = drop_units(intersect_area / total_area)) %&gt;% \n    mutate(pop_weighted = pop_total * weight)\n\nglimpse(interpolate_manual_pop %&gt;% \n            select(GEOID, NAME, pop_total, \n                   total_area, intersect_area, weight, \n                   pop_weighted))\n\nRows: 43\nColumns: 8\n$ GEOID          &lt;chr&gt; \"060670079043\", \"060670078012\", \"060670058041\", \"060670…\n$ NAME           &lt;chr&gt; \"Block Group 3, Census Tract 79.04, Sacramento County, …\n$ pop_total      &lt;dbl&gt; 1167, 1842, 963, 2185, 751, 660, 2288, 2435, 761, 1992,…\n$ total_area     [m^2] 573602.4 [m^2], 1214861.6 [m^2], 742430.6 [m^2], 974344…\n$ intersect_area [m^2] 436050.8824 [m^2], 1214861.6295 [m^2], 17898.9277 [m^2]…\n$ weight         &lt;dbl&gt; 0.760197080, 1.000000000, 0.024108554, 0.221407985, 1.0…\n$ pop_weighted   &lt;dbl&gt; 887.1499923, 1842.0000000, 23.2165377, 483.7764476, 751…\n$ geometry       &lt;GEOMETRY [m]&gt; POLYGON ((-113200.2 71785.2..., POLYGON ((-113…\n\n\nThe weighted average population for the water system is the sum of the area weighted population within each of the intersecting portions of the census units.\n\n# this should be the same as the interpolated result\npop_est_weighted_manual &lt;- interpolate_manual_pop %&gt;% \n    pull(pop_weighted) %&gt;% \n    sum() %&gt;% \n    round(digits = 0)\npop_est_weighted_manual\n\n[1] 39321\n\n\nSo, as a final check, the ‘manually’ calculated total population for CARMICHAEL WATER DISTRICT is 39,321, and the value obtained from the aw_interpolate function above was 39,321.\n\n\n5.5.2 Median Household Income\nThe methodology for calculating a variable like median household income, which doesn’t represent a count (unlinke the population example in Section 5.5.1 above) is a bit different. Computations on variables which represent averages, medians, percentages, densities, etc. are known as spatially intensive operations (see this documenation for more information).\n\n# get the estimated median household income for this supplier from above\nmed_hh_income_interp &lt;- water_systems_sac_demographics %&gt;% \n    filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_check) %&gt;% \n    pull(med_hh_income_est)\n\nIn this case, we’ll check the calculation for the water system: CARMICHAEL WATER DISTRICT. The estimated median household income for this system using the areal interpolation above (Section 5.2) was: $99,561.\nAs with the population calculation, we’ll first get the portions of the census units that intersect the target water system’s service area. They are shown in red in Figure 10 above.\n\ninterpolate_manual_hh_inc &lt;- st_intersection(census_data_acs, \n                                             water_systems_sac %&gt;%\n                                                 filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_check))\n\nNext, we need to account for census units where median household income is missing (missing values are represented as NA in our census dataset), in this case by removing them from the calculation (like we did above in Section 5.2.1) – in this case that’s 1 census unit(s) with missing median household income data. Note that simply removing census units with missing data could impact the quality of our calculations if there are significant portions of the service area covered by census units that contain missing values for this variable, and in a real-world analysis it may be necessary to do additional work to investigate and make adjustments to account for these missing values. However, in this case we’ll just drop them for simplicity.\n\nsum(is.na(interpolate_manual_hh_inc$med_hh_income))\n\n[1] 1\n\ninterpolate_manual_hh_inc &lt;- interpolate_manual_hh_inc %&gt;% \n    filter(!is.na(med_hh_income))\n\nThen we’ll compute the combined area of the portions of the census units that intersect the water system area.\n\n# get portion of census units that intersect the system area ----\ninterpolate_manual_hh_inc &lt;- interpolate_manual_hh_inc %&gt;% \n    mutate(intersect_area = st_area(.))\n\n# compute combined area of all census segments that intersect the system area\ntotal_intersection_area &lt;- sum(interpolate_manual_hh_inc$intersect_area)\n\nNext we’ll a compute weights for the census units that intersect the water system area.

The estimated population for this system using the areal weighted interpolation with the aw_interpolate function above (Section 5.2) was: 0.\nTo check this result, we’ll first get the portions of the census units that intersect the target water system’s service area, as was done for the other ‘manual’ calculations above. This is shown in Figure 11 below, with the water system boundary is shown in black, census unit(s) overlapping the water system shown in grey, and intersecting portion(s) of the census unit(s) shown in red.\n\n# get portion of census units that intersect the system area ----\ninterpolate_manual_zero &lt;- st_intersection(census_data_acs %&gt;% \n                                               mutate(total_area = st_area(.)), \n                                           water_systems_sac %&gt;%\n                                               filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_check_zero))\n\n# make a plot to check the intersection\n## plot census units that overlap the system area\nplot_manual_check_zero &lt;- ggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data = census_data_acs %&gt;%\n                st_filter(water_systems_sac %&gt;%\n                              filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_check_zero)),\n            fill = alpha('grey', 0.8),\n            color = 'grey',\n            linewidth = 0.5,\n            show.legend = FALSE) +\n    geom_sf(data = water_systems_sac %&gt;%\n                filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_check_zero),\n            fill = NA,\n            color = alpha('black', 1),\n            linewidth = 2) +\n    geom_sf(data = interpolate_manual_zero,\n            fill = NA,\n            color = 'red',\n            linewidth = 0.5) + \n    theme_void()\n\n# show the plot\nplot_manual_check_zero\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Portions of census units (red) intersecting the water system service area (black).\n\n\n\n\nThen we’ll estimate the population within each of those intersecting portions of the census units by computing an area weighted population (as was done above in Section 5.5.1) .\n\ninterpolate_manual_zero &lt;- interpolate_manual_zero %&gt;% \n    mutate(intersect_area = st_area(.)) %&gt;% \n    mutate(weight = drop_units(intersect_area / total_area)) %&gt;% \n    mutate(pop_weighted = pop_total * weight)\n\nglimpse(interpolate_manual_zero %&gt;% \n            select(GEOID, NAME, pop_total, \n                   total_area, intersect_area, weight, \n                   pop_weighted))\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 8\n$ GEOID          &lt;chr&gt; \"060670098001\"\n$ NAME           &lt;chr&gt; \"Block Group 1, Census Tract 98, Sacramento County, Cal…\n$ pop_total      &lt;dbl&gt; 822\n$ total_area     [m^2] 22669410 [m^2]\n$ intersect_area [m^2] 2523.735 [m^2]\n$ weight         &lt;dbl&gt; 0.0001113278\n$ pop_weighted   &lt;dbl&gt; 0.09151145\n$ geometry       &lt;POLYGON [m]&gt; POLYGON ((-138282.2 13643.2...\n\n\nThe weighted average population for the water system is the sum of the area weighted population within each of the intersecting portions of the census unit(s).\n\n# this should be the same as the interpolated result\npop_est_weighted_manual_zero &lt;- interpolate_manual_zero %&gt;% \n    pull(pop_weighted) %&gt;% \n    sum() \npop_est_weighted_manual_zero\n\n[1] 0.09151145\n\n\nIn this case, the (un-rounded) ‘manually’ calculated total population for B & W RESORT MARINA is 0.09151145 (for reference, the rounded value obtained from the aw_interpolate function was 0). From the Figure 11 above, you can see that the service area reported for this system is very small, only covering a small fraction of a single census unit, resulting in a population estimate that is very low. In this case, it could be that the system area was drawn incorrectly (i.e., maybe it doesn’t really depict the entire service area), in which case the reported service area should be revised. Or, it’s possible that the population within the given census unit is very un-evenly distributed and instead there’s a relatively high density population cluster in the depicted service area, in which case a more sophisticated method than an area-weighted average should be used (e.g., maybe consider the density of buildings, roads, and/or other features associated with inhabited areas)."
