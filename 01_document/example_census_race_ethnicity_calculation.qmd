::: callout-warning
This document is a work in progress, and may change significantly.
:::

This document provides an example of how to use tools available from the [R programming language](https://www.R-project.org/) [@R] to estimate characteristics of any given *target* spatial area(s) (e.g., neighborhoods, project boundaries, water supplier service areas, etc.) based on data from a *source* dataset containing the characteristic data of interest (e.g., census data, CalEnvrioScreen scores, etc.), especially when the boundaries of the *source* and *target* areas overlap but don't necessarily align with each other. It also provides some brief background on the various types of data available from the U.S Census Bureau, and links to a few places to find more in-depth information.

This particular example estimates demographic characteristics of community water systems in the Sacramento County area (the *target* dataset). It uses the [`tidycensus`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html) R package [@tidycensus] to access selected demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau (the *source* dataset) for census units whose spatial extent covers those water systems' service areas, then uses the [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package [@sf] package (for working with spatial data) and the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) collection of packages [@tidyverse] (for general data cleaning and transformation) to estimate some demographic characteristics of each water system based on that census data. It also uses the [`areal`](https://chris-prener.github.io/areal/) R package [@areal] to check some of the results, and as general guidance on the principles and techniques for implementing areal interpolation.

This example is just intended to be a simplified demonstration of a possible workflow. For a real analysis, additional steps and considerations -- that may not be covered here -- may be needed to deal with data inconsistencies (e.g., missing or incomplete data), required level of precision and acceptable assumptions (e.g. more fine-grained datasets or more sophisticated techniques could be used to estimate/model population distributions), or other project-specific issues that might arise.

## Census Data Overview {#sec-census-overview}

This section provides some brief background on the various types of data available from the U.S. Census Bureau (a later section - @sec-census-access - demonstrates how to retrieve data from the U.S. Census Bureau using the [`tidycensus`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html) R package). Most of the information covered here comes from the book [Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html), which is a great source of information if you'd like more detail about any of the topics below [@walker2023].

::: callout-note
If you're already familiar with Census data and want to skip this overview, go directly to the next section: @sec-system-boundaries
:::

Different census products/surveys contain data on different variables, at different geographic scales, over varying periods of time, and with varying levels of certainty. Therefore, there are a number of judgement calls to make when determining which type of census data to use for an analysis -- e.g., which data product to use (Decennial Census or American Community Survey), which geographic scale to use (e.g., Block, Block Group, Tract, etc.), what time frame to use, which variables to assess, etc.

More detailed information about U.S. Census Bureau's data products and other topics mentioned below is available [here](https://walker-data.com/census-r/the-united-states-census-and-the-r-programming-language.html#the-united-states-census-and-the-r-programming-language).

### Census Unit Geography / Hierarchy {#sec-census-hierarchy}

Publicly available datasets from the U.S Census Bureau generally consist of individual survey responses aggregated to defined census units (e.g., census tracts) that cover varying geographic scales. Some of these units are nested and can be neatly aggregated (e.g., each census tract is composed of a collection of block groups, and each block group is composed of a collection of blocks), while other census units are outside this hierarchy (e.g., Zip Code Tabulation Areas don't coincide with any other census unit). @fig-census-hierarchies shows the relationship of all of the various census units.

Commonly used census statistical units like tracts and block groups have target population size ranges, and can be adjusted every 10 years (with the decennial census) based on population changes. For example, all ACS 5-year datasets prior to 2020 use the 2010 boundaries for tracts, block groups, and blocks, and all ACS 5-year datasets from [2020 onward](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2020/geography-changes.html) (presumably through 2029) use the 2020 boundaries for those units. [Census tracts](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_13) are generally around 4,000 people, with a range from about 1,200 to 8,000, and [block groups](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_4) generally contain 600 to 3,000 people. [Blocks](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_5) are the smallest census units, and are "areas bounded by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by nonvisible boundaries, such as selected property lines and city, township, school district, and county limits and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads". For example, a census block may be "a city block bounded on all sides by streets", while "blocks in suburban and rural areas may be larger, more irregular in shape, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads, streams, and transmission lines".

::: callout-caution
Census boundaries can change over time. Commonly used statistical units like tracts, block groups, and blocks tend to be revised every 10 years (with the decennial census), so it's important to use a census boundary dataset that matches the version of the census demographic data you're retrieving; otherwise, the demographic data may not match geographic areas in your boundary dataset. In some cases, a census unit that exists in a given year of the census data may not exist at all in a different year's dataset, because census units can be split or merged when boundaries are revised.

For more information, see [here](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/acs/acs_geography_handbook_2020_ch02.pdf) or [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/geography-acs/geography-boundaries-by-year.html) or [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_6) or [here](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/data-gems/2021/compare-2020-census-and-2010-census-redistricting-data.html).

![Census Unit Hierarchies](https://walker-data.com/census-r/img/screenshots/census-hierarchies.png){#fig-census-hierarchies}

### Census Datasets / Surveys {#sec-census-datasets}

The Decennial Census is conducted every 10 years, and is intended to provide a complete count of the US population and assist with political redistricting. As a result, it collects a relatively limited set of basic demographic data, but (should) provide a high degree of precision (i.e., in general it should provide exact counts). It is available for geographic units down to the census block (the smallest census unit available -- see @sec-census-hierarchy). For information about existing and planned future releases of 2020 census data products, go [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/planning-management/release/about-2020-data-products.html).

The American Community Survey (ACS) provides a much larger array of demographic information than the Decennial Census, and is updated more frequently. The ACS is based on a sample of the population (rather than a count of the entire population, as in the Decennial Census), so it represents estimated values rather than precise counts; therefore, each data point is available as an estimate (typically labeled with an "E" in census variable codes, which are discussed in @sec-census-variables ) along with an associated margin of error (typically labeled with "M" or "MOE" in census variable codes) around its estimated value.

The ACS is available in two formats. The 5-year ACS is a rolling average of 5 years of data (e.g., the 2021 5-year ACS dataset is an average of the ACS data from 2017 through 2021), and is generally available for geographic units down to the census block group (though some 5-year ACS data may only be available at less granular levels). The 1-year ACS provides data for a single year, and is only available for geographies with population greater than 65,000 (e.g., large cities and counties). Therefore, only the 5-year ACS will be useful for any analysis at a relatively fine scale (e.g., anything that requires data at or more detailed than the census tract level, or any analysis that considers smaller counties/cities -- by definition, census tracts always contain significantly fewer than 65,000 people).

In addition to the Decennial Census and ACS data, a number of other census data products/surveys are also available. For example, see the `censusapi` R package ([here](https://github.com/hrecht/censusapi) or [here](https://www.hrecht.com/censusapi/index.html)) for access to over 300 census API endpoints. For historical census data, see the discussion [here](https://walker-data.com/census-r/other-census-and-government-data-resources.html?q=API%20endpoint#other-census-and-government-data-resources) on using NHGIS, IPUMS, and the `ipumsr` package.

### Census Variables / Codes {#sec-census-variables}

Each census product collects data for many different demographic variables, and each variable is generally associated with an identifier code. In order to access census data programmatically, you often need to know the code associated with each variable of interest. When determining which variables to use, you need to consider what census product contains those variables (see @sec-census-datasets) and how they differ in terms of time frame, precision, spatial granularity (see @sec-census-hierarchy), etc.

The `tidycensus` package offers a convenient generic way to search for variables across different census products using the `load_variables()` function, as described [here](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html#searching-for-variables).

The following websites may also be helpful for exploring the various census data products and finding the variable names and codes they contain:

    -   2020 Census codes: <https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/pl/variables.html>

    -   2022 ACS 5 year codes: <https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5/variables.html>

## Target Data Boundaries (Water Systems) {#sec-system-boundaries}

In this section, we'll get the service area boundaries for Community Water Systems within the Sacramento County area. This will serve as the *target* dataset – i.e., the set of areas which we'll be estimating the characteristics of – and will also be used to specifying what census data we want to retrieve. We'll also get a dataset of county boundaries which overlap the water service areas in this study, which can also help with specifying what census data to access and/or with making maps and visualizations.

### Read Water System Data

In this case, we'll get the water system dataset from a shapefile that's saved locally, then transform that dataset into a common coordinate reference system for mapping and analysis (which is defined above in the variable `crs_projected`).

This water system dataset comes from the [California Drinking Water System Area Boundaries dataset](https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/home/item.html?id=fbba842bf134497c9d611ad506ec48cc). For this example, the dataset has been pre-filtered for systems within Sacramento County (by selecting records where the `COUNTY` field is "SACRAMENTO") and for Community Water Systems (by selecting records where the `STATE_CLAS` field is "COMMUNITY"). Some un-needed fields have also been dropped, remaining fields have been re-orderd.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: hide

water_systems_sac <- st_read(here('02_data_input', 
                                  'water_supplier_boundaries_sac', 
                                  'System_Area_Boundary_Layer_Sac.shp')) %>% 
    st_transform(crs_projected) # transform to common coordinate system
```

We can use the `glimpse` function (below) to take get a sense of what type of information is available in the water system dataset and how it's structured.

Note that this dataset already includes a `POPULATION` variable that indicates the population served by each water system. However, for this analysis we'll be making our own estimate of the population within each system's service area based on U.S. Census Bureau data and the spatial representation of the system boundaries. I don't know exactly how the `POPULATION` variable was derived in this dataset, and it likely will not exactly match the population estimates from this analysis, but may serve as a useful check to make sure our estimates are reasonable.

```{r}
glimpse(water_systems_sac)
```

#### Alternative Data Retrieval Method

Reading in data from a shapefile is shown above because it's likely one of the more common ways that users will access their *target* boundary data. However, depending on the dataset, there may be other ways to access the data. For example, the code chunk below demonstrates an alternative -- using the [`arcgislayers`](https://r.esri.com/arcgislayers/index.html) package [@arcgislayers] -- that connects directly to the source dataset (to retrieve the most recent version) and applies the filters needed to reproduce the dataset in the `System_Area_Boundary_Layer_Sac.shp` file.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# load arcgislayers package (see: https://r.esri.com/arcgislayers/index.html)
install.packages('pak') # only needed if the pak package is not already installed
pak::pkg_install("R-ArcGIS/arcgislayers", dependencies = TRUE)

library(arcgislayers)

# define link to data source
url_feature <- 'https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portalserver/rest/services/Drinking_Water/California_Drinking_Water_System_Area_Boundaries/FeatureServer/0'

# connect to data source
water_systems_feature_layer <- arc_open(url_feature)

# download and filter data from source
water_systems_sac <- arc_select(
  water_systems_feature_layer,
  # apply filters
  where = "COUNTY = 'SACRAMENTO' AND STATE_CLASSIFICATION = 'COMMUNITY'",
  # select fields
  fields = c('WATER_SYSTEM_NAME', 'WATER_SYSTEM_NUMBER', 'GLOBALID',
             'BOUNDARY_TYPE', 'OWNER_TYPE_CODE', 'COUNTY',
             'REGULATING_AGENCY', 'FEDERAL_CLASSIFICATION', 'STATE_CLASSIFICATION',
             'SERVICE_CONNECTIONS', 'POPULATION')) %>%
    # transform to common coordinate system
    st_transform(crs_projected) %>%
    # rename fields to match names from the shapefile (which automatically truncates field names)
    rename(WATER_SY_1 = WATER_SYSTEM_NAME,
           WATER_SYST = WATER_SYSTEM_NUMBER,
           BOUNDARY_T = BOUNDARY_TYPE,
           OWNER_TYPE = OWNER_TYPE_CODE,
           REGULATING = REGULATING_AGENCY,
           FEDERAL_CL = FEDERAL_CLASSIFICATION,
           STATE_CLAS = STATE_CLASSIFICATION,
           SERVICE_CO = SERVICE_CONNECTIONS)
```

### Get County Boundaries {#sec-county-boundaries}

When accessing census data using the `tidycensus` R package as shown below (in @sec-census-access), it's often useful (though not strictly required) to know which counties overlap the target dataset (note that, even though the dataset is filtered for systems in Sacramento county, there are some systems whose boundaries extend into neighboring counties). County boundaries may also be useful for making maps in later stages of the analysis. We can get a dataset of county boundaries in California from the [TIGER dataset](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html), which can be accessed with R using the [`tigris`](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) R package [@tigris].

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: hide

counties_ca <- counties(state = 'CA', 
                        cb = TRUE) %>% # simplified
    st_transform(crs_projected) # transform to common coordinate system
```

Then, we can get a list of counties that overlap with the boundaries of the Sacramento area community water systems obtained above.

```{r}
counties_overlap <- counties_ca %>% 
    st_filter(water_systems_sac, 
              .predicate = st_overlaps)

counties_list <- counties_overlap %>% pull(NAME)
```

The counties in the `counties_list` variable are: `r counties_list`.

### Plot Target Data

@fig-suppliers-counties shows the water systems and county boundaries in an interactive map.

```{r}
#| label: fig-suppliers-counties
#| fig-cap: "Selected water systems (with county boundaries for reference)."

mapview(counties_overlap, 
        alpha.regions = 0, 
        zcol = 'NAME', 
        layer.name = 'County', 
        legend = FALSE) + 
    mapview(water_systems_sac, 
            zcol = 'WATER_SY_1', 
            layer.name = 'Water System', 
            legend = FALSE)
```

## Accessing Census Data {#sec-census-access}

The following sections demonstrate how to retrieve census data from the Decennial Census and the ACS using the [`tidycensus`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html) R package.

In order to use the `tidycensus` R package, you'll need to obtain a personal API key from the US Census Bureau (which is free and available to anyone) by signing up here: <http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>. Once you have your API key, you'll need to register it in R by entering the command `census_api_key(key = "YOUR API KEY", install = TRUE)` in the console. Note that the `install = TRUE` argument means that the key is saved for all future R sessions, so you'll only need to run that command once on your computer (rather than including it in your scripts). Alternatively, you could save your key to an environment variable and retrieve it using `Sys.getenv()`. Either way will help you avoid the possibility of entering your API key into any scripts that could be shared publicly.

::: callout-caution
Because the boundaries of census units (e.g., tracts, block groups, blocks, etc) can change over time, it's important to make sure that the version (year) of the census data you're retrieving matches the version of the census boundary dataset you're using. The methods shown below retrieve the census boundary dataset together with the census demographic data, which ensures that this won't be a potential problem. However, if you use a different workflow that retrieves the geographic boundaries and demographic data via separate processes, you should ensure that the versions are consistent.
:::

### Decennial Census {#sec-census-access-decennial}

This section retrieves census data from the Decennial Census, using the `get_decennial` function from the `tidycensus` package. As of this writing, the most recent version of the decennial census data available is from 2020, and we can set that as a variable below.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: hide

# set year
decennial_year <- 2020
```

Next, we can define the list of demographic variables we'd like to retrieve tabular data for, by saving the census variables we want in the `census_vars_decennial` object (see @sec-census-variables for more information about how to discover variables of interest and find their associated codes). Note that here we're providing descriptive names associated with each variable code, which makes the data easier to work with later, but isn't strictly necessary (i.e., you could just supply the variable codes alone).

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: hide

# define variables to pull from the decennial census
census_vars_decennial <- c(
    'population_hispanic_or_latino_count' = 'P2_002N', # Total Hispanic or Latino
    'population_white_count' = 'P2_005N', # White (Not Hispanic or Latino)
    'population_black_or_african_american_count' = 'P2_006N', # Black or African American (Not Hispanic or Latino)
    'population_native_american_or_alaska_native_count' = 'P2_007N', # American Indian and Alaska Native (Not Hispanic or Latino)
    'population_asian_count' = 'P2_008N', # Asian (Not Hispanic or Latino)
    'population_pacific_islander_count' = 'P2_009N', # Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (Not Hispanic or Latino)
    'population_other_count' = 'P2_010N', # Some other race (Not Hispanic or Latino)
    'population_multiple_count' = 'P2_011N', # Two or more races (Not Hispanic or Latino)
    'population_total_count' = 'P2_001N'
)
```

Then, we can create an object that we can use to filter our request to the census API so that it will only return census units that overlap with our target areas (the object will be passed to the `filter_by` argument of the `get_decennial` function below). Note that this isn't strictly necessary (you could also apply the filter after making the API request), but may helpful to speed the query and reduce memory usage, especially in the case of large queries.

::: callout-note
At the time of this writing, the `filter_by` argument of the tidycensus `get_decennial` function is fairly new, and not yet included in the official documentation.

Also, the `filter_by` argument is optional, and only appears to accept a simple features (sf) object with a single row / feature (e.g., a single water system), and will not accept an sf object with multiple rows / features. The process below attempts to work around this constraint by joining all of the selected water systems into a single multi-part polygon (i.e., an sf object with a single row). However, if you only want to retrieve data for census units that overlap a single target area (e.g., a single water system), you can skip this step.
:::

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: hide
#| lst-label: lst-filter_obj
#| lst-cap: Create object for filtering the API query

water_systems_filter <- water_systems_sac %>% 
    st_union() %>% 
    st_as_sf()
```

Finally, we can make the data request, using the `get_decennial` function, which accepts several arguments that specify exactly what data to return.

For this example we're getting data at the 'Block' level (with the `geography = 'block'` argument) for the demographic variables defined above in the `census_vars_decennial` object (which is passed to the `variables` argument). As noted above, block-level data is the most granular level of spatial data available, and should provide the best results when estimating demographics for areas whose boundaries don't align with census unit boundaries. However, depending on the use case, it may require too much time and computational resources to use the most granular spatial data, and may not be necessary to obtain a reasonable estimate. Also, keep in mind that block-level data may not be available for all variables, and some variables may only be available at less granular spatial scales (like block groups or tracts).

In addition to the tabular data associated with the demographic variables in our list, we'll also get the spatial data -- i.e., the boundaries of the census blocks -- by setting the `geometry = TRUE` argument. When we do this, the tabular demographic data is pre-joined to the spatial data, so the API request returns a single dataset with both the spatial and attribute (demographic) data combined.

::: callout-note
The `tidycensus` package generally returns the Census Bureau's [cartographic boundary shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html) by default (as opposed to the [core TIGER/Line shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html), which is the default format returned by the `tigris` R package). The default cartographic boundary shapefiles are pre-clipped to the US coastline, and are smaller/faster to process (alternatively you can use `cb = FALSE` to get the core TIGER/Line data) (see [here](https://walker-data.com/census-r/spatial-analysis-with-us-census-data.html#better-cartography-with-spatial-overlay)). So the default spatial data returned by `tidycensus` may be somewhat different than the default spatial data returned by the `tigris` package, but in general I find it's best to use the default `tidycensus` spatial data.
:::

::: callout-warning
At the block level, it appears that `tidycensus` only returns the more detailed core TIGER/Line shapefiles (i.e., they are identical to the default block-level geographic data returned by `tigris`). In some cases, that can create minor inconsistencies when working with both blocks and block groups and using the default geographies.
:::

We also narrow down the search parameters geographically by specifying the state (with `state = 'CA'`) and counties (`county = counties_list`) we're seeking data for.

::: callout-note
Supplying a list of counties may not be strictly necessary, especially in cases where you supply the optional `filter_by` argument. However, especially when working with granular data like blocks, supplying the county argument seems to greatly speed the API request.
:::

Also, while by default the `tidycensus` package returns data in long/tidy format, we're getting the data in wide format for this example (by specifying `output = 'wide'`) because it'll be easier to work with for the interpolation method described below to estimate demographics for non-census geographies.

```

The output is an sf object (i.e., a dataframe-like object that also includes spatial data), in wide format, where each row represents a census unit, and the population of each racial/ethnic group is reported in a separate column. Here's a view of the contents and structure of the Decennial Census data that's returned:

```{r}
glimpse(census_data_decennial)
```

### American Community Survey (ACS) {#sec-census-access-acs}

To get data from the ACS, you can use the `get_acs()` function, which is very similar to the `get_decennial()` function used above. As of this writing, the most recent version of the 5-year ACS data available is the 2018-2022 ACS, and we can set that as a variable below (which makes it easier to update this document in future years).

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: hide

# set year
acs_year <- 2022
```

However, since the ACS data contains data on a much broader set of socio-economic metrics, the requested data includes a greatly expanded list of variables, defined in the `census_vars_acs` object (see @sec-census-variables for more information about how to discover variables of interest and find their associated codes). As above, we can provide descriptive names associated with each variable code, which makes the data easier to work with later, but isn't strictly necessary (i.e., you could just supply the variable codes alone).

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

Finally, we can make the data request, using the `get_acs` function, which is very similar to the `get_decennial` function described above ( @sec-census-access-decennial). However, for this example we're getting data at the 'Block Group' level (with the `geography = 'block group'` argument), which is the most granular level of spatial data available for ACS data. But, keep in mind that block group-level data may not be available for all variables, and some variables may only be available at less granular spatial scales (like tracts). Note that the `water_systems_filter` object supplied to the `filter_by` argument was created above in @lst-filter_obj.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: hide
#| lst-label: lst-get_acs
#| lst-cap: Retrieve ACS data

# get census data
census_data_acs <- get_acs(geography = 'block group',
                           state = 'CA', 
                           county = counties_list,
                           filter_by = water_systems_filter,
                           year = acs_year,
                           survey = 'acs5',
                           variables = census_vars_acs, 
                           output = 'wide', # can be 'wide' or 'tidy'
                           geometry = TRUE,
                           cache_table = TRUE) %>% 
    st_transform(crs_projected) # convert to common coordinate system
```

As above, the output is an sf object (i.e., a dataframe-like object that also includes spatial data), in wide format, where each row represents a census unit, and the each demographic variable is reported in a separate column. Here's a view of the contents and structure of the `r acs_year` 5-year ACS data that's returned (only the first few fields are shown):

```{r}
glimpse(census_data_acs[,1:20])
```

Note that the dataset that's returned includes fields corresponding to Margin of Error (MOE) for each variable we've requested (these are the fields that end with two digits and an M -- e.g., "001M"), since, as noted above in @sec-census-datasets , the ACS is based on a sample of the population and reports estimated values.

::: callout-tip
It is possible to calculate MOEs for derived estimates – e.g., when aggregating groups of census units – and in many cases it may be worthwhile to do that to provide extra context to the data. However, it may be difficult to do for more complex aggregations, such as the areal interpolation shown below. For guidance on how calculate MOEs for some types of derived estimates, see [this document](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/acs/acs_general_handbook_2020_ch08.pdf).

`tidycensus` also has functions for calculating derives margins of error based on Census-supplied formulas, including [`moe_sum()`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/reference/moe_sum.html), [`moe_product()`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/reference/moe_product.html), [`moe_ratio()`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/reference/moe_ratio.html), and [`moe_prop()`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/reference/moe_prop.html).
:::

Because we won't be incorporating those MOEs into the analysis below, we can drop them for this example, then clean up the field names.

```{r}
# drop MOE fields
census_data_acs <- census_data_acs %>% 
     select(-matches('M$')) # the $ specifies "ends with"

# clean names
names(census_data_acs) <- names(census_data_acs) %>% 
    str_remove('E$') %>% # remove 'E' (estimate) from field names
    str_replace('NAM', 'NAME') # add 'E' back to NAME field
```

Here's a view of the contents and structure of the revised `r acs_year` 5-year ACS dataset (only the first few fields are shown):

```{r}
glimpse(census_data_acs[,1:20])
```

For further analysis, we may want to get the statewide data as a baseline for comparison (this could also be done for other scales, like the county level). We can use a similar process to get that data and clean/format it to match the more detailed data obtained above. Note that in this case we're also using the 5-year ACS (even though the 1-year ACS is also available at the statewide level, and would provide more up-to-date data) so that the statewide data will be directly comparable to the block group level data obtained above.

census_data_acs_state <- get_acs(geography = 'state',
                                 state = 'CA', 
                                 year = acs_year,
                                 survey = 'acs5',
                                 variables = census_vars_acs, 
                                 output = 'wide', # can be 'wide' or 'tidy'

    st_transform(crs_projected) %>%  # convert to common coordinate system
    select(-matches('M$')) %>%  # the $ specifies "ends with"
    # clean names (note this is a little different than the way we renamed fields above, either works)
    rename_with(.fn = ~ str_remove(., # remove 'E' (estimate) from field names
                                    pattern = 'E$')) %>% 
    rename_with(.fn = ~ str_replace(., # add 'E' back to NAME field
                                    pattern = 'NAM', 
                                    replacement = 'NAME'))
```

## Compute Water System Demographics {#sec-estimate-demographics}

Now we can perform the calculations to estimate demographic characteristics for our *target* areas (water system service boundaries in the Sacramento County area) from our *source* demographic dataset (the census data we obtained above). For this example, we'll use the `r acs_year` 5-year ACS data that we retrieved above (which is saved in the `census_data_acs` variable) as our source of demographic data, and we'll estimate the following for each water system's service area:

-   Population of each racial/ethnic group (using the racial/ethnic categories defined in the census dataset), and each racial/ethnic group's portion of the total service area population
-   Socio-economic variables like poverty rate, median household income, income distributions, and per capita income

There are multiple ways this estimation can be done. For this example, we'll employ a three step strategy:

1.  Estimate values for count-based variables (typically referred to as 'extensive' data types) -- e.g., total population, popultion by race/ethnicity, population above / below poverty rate, households by income bracket -- for overlapping census unit, using areal interpolation. This is essentially an area weighted average, which estimates how much of each *source* unit's (census unit) count applies to the *target* area (a given water service area), based on the portion of its area that overlaps that target area -- for more information about the process, see [this documentation](https://chris-prener.github.io/areal/articles/areal-weighted-interpolation.html) from the `areal` R package. For example, for a census unit that partially overlaps a service area, only a fraction of its count for a given variable will be applied to that service area; for a census unit that completely overlaps a service area, the full count for that variable will be applied to the service area.

    The major simplifying assumption of this approach is that the population or count-based variable of interest are evenly distributed within each unit in the *source* data. For example, in this case we're assuming that population (including the total population and the population of each racial/ethic group), households of each income bracket, populations above / below the poverty rate, etc. are evenly distributed within each census block group.

::: callout-tip
While this section uses the block group-level count data from the 5-year ACS, there may be cases where it could be useful or necessary to use more granular block-level population data from the decennial census to estimate population densities and distributions within larger census units, like block groups and tracts. This could especially be the case when estimating characteristics for small areas in rural environments. See @sec-small-area-estimates and/or @sec-detailed-pop-estimates for more information.
:::

2.  Using the estimated count data (populations, households, etc), compute weighted values for variables that describe those populations, using the associated count data as a weighting factor (e.g., population-weighted values for population based data, or household-weighted values for household-based data) -- these variables are typically referred to as 'intensive' data types.

::: callout-tip
Although it's possible to use areal interpolation to aggregate these variables as well, the multi-step approach described here can be useful because we know (from the population / household count data) that population densities differ between census units. Since we have a reasonable estimate of the count data (population, households, etc) within each census unit, using a population or household weighted average likely will yield more accurate results than a simple area-weighted average for these variables. For example, for per capita income, we can use the estimated population counts to produce a population weighted average per capita income (rather than an area weighted average per capita income, which is likely less meaningful as it over-weights large census areas with lower population densities). Areal interpolation may be more useful for cases where we generally have no other information about how density varies between the source polygons (unless significantly more effort is invested, such as looking at aerial imagery data)
:::

3.  Aggregate interpolated values at the water system level.

### Prepare Census Data

Note that we already transformed the `r acs_year` 5-year ACS dataset into the common projected coordinate reference system used for this example immediately after we downloaded the data using the `get_acs()` function (see @lst-get_acs). This allows us to work with the water system data and the census data together in a common coordinate system.

Before calculating demographics for the *target* areas, we can do a bit of additional transformation to prepare the census data if needed. For example, we can combine the 'other' and 'multiple' racial/ethnic groupings into one 'other or multiple' racial/ethnic group.

```{r edit_census_data}
## combine other and multiple
census_data_acs <- census_data_acs %>% 
    mutate('population_other_or_multiple_count' = population_other_count + population_multiple_count, 
           .after = population_pacific_islander_count) %>% 
    select(-c(population_other_count, population_multiple_count))
```

We can also calculate the poverty rate for each census unit (which may be useful for presenting results later).

```{r}
census_data_acs <- census_data_acs %>% 
    mutate(poverty_rate_pct_calc_census_unit = case_when(
        poverty_total_assessed_count == 0 ~ 0,
        .default = 100 * poverty_below_count / poverty_total_assessed_count
    ), 
    .after = poverty_above_count)
```

```{r}
# We can also drop census units with zero population, since they won't contribute anything to our calculations.

## drop census units with zero population
# census_data_acs <- census_data_acs %>% 
#     filter(population_total > 0)
```

### Interpolation Step 1: Areal Interpolation (for Count Variables) {#sec-areal-interp}

There are a couple of ways to implement the areal interpolation method. The example below 'manually' implements the process using functions from the `sf` package, for reasons described below. However, note that there are R packages which make it possible to perform areal interpolation with a single function - for example, the `sf` package's [`st_interpolate_aw`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/interpolate_aw.html) function and the [`areal`](https://chris-prener.github.io/areal/) package's [`aw_interpolate`](https://chris-prener.github.io/areal/reference/aw_interpolate.html) function. This example uses a more 'manual' approach because this makes it possible to use the multi-step process described above, and also produces useful intermediate calculated data for mapping and visualization. However, we can use the single-function approach to double check our implementation of the areal interpolation approach for the count data (see @sec-check-areal-interp).

First, we clip the census data to the water system boundaries:

```{r}
#| warning: false

census_data_clip <- census_data_acs %>% 
    mutate(cenus_unit_area = st_area(.)) %>% 
    st_intersection(water_systems_sac) %>% 
    mutate(clipped_area = st_area(.)) %>% 
    mutate(areal_weight_factor = drop_units(clipped_area / cenus_unit_area))
```

@fig-map-clipped-polygons shows a plot of the census units clipped to the `{r} str_to_title(system_plot)` water system, along with the original/complete census units. Note that you can toggle layers on and off (and change their order of appearance) using the layers button in the upper left part of the map (below the zoom buttons).

::: {#fig-map-clipped-polygons}
```{r}
#| warning: false
# label: fig-map-clipped-polygons
# fig-cap: "Water systems (filled polygons), boundaries of overalpping census units (grey), and clipped portions of census units (light blue) that will be used to estimate water system demographics."

mapview(water_systems_sac %>% 
            filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_plot), 
        zcol = 'WATER_SY_1', 
        layer.name = 'Water System', 
        legend = FALSE) + 
    mapview(census_data_acs %>% 
                st_filter(water_systems_sac %>% 
                              filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_plot)), 
            alpha.regions = 0.15, 
            col.regions = 'grey', 
            color = 'black', 
            lwd = 1, 
            label = 'NAME',  
            layer.name = 'ACS Data Full', 
            legend = FALSE) +
    mapview(census_data_clip %>% 
                filter(WATER_SY_1 == system_plot),
            alpha.regions = 0, 
            color = 'cyan', 
            lwd = 1.3, 
            label = 'NAME',  
            layer.name = 'ACS Data Clipped', 
            legend = FALSE)
```

Water system `{r} str_to_title(system_plot)` (filled polygon), boundaries of overalpping census units (grey), and clipped portions of census units (light blue) that will be used to estimate water system demographics.
:::

Next, we can compute the area-weighted counts for the portions of census units that overlap each water system boundary:

```{r}
census_data_interpolate <- census_data_clip %>% 
    mutate(
        across(
            .cols = ends_with('_count'),
            .fns = ~ .x * areal_weight_factor #,
            # .names = "{str_replace(.col, 'population_', 'percent_')}"
        )) 
```

As noted above, it's also possible to use pre-built functions from several R packages to perform areal interpolation in a single step. Since we're using a three-step process, which also implements population weighted averaging for some variables, we're not using those functions directly in this example. However, they can be a useful check to validate our computed count data, but only after we aggregate our data at the system level -- see @sec-check-areal-interp for more details.

census_data_interpolate <- census_data_interpolate %>% 
    mutate(average_household_size_weighted = average_household_size * households_count,
           median_household_income_weighted = median_household_income * households_count,
           per_capita_income_weighted = per_capita_income * population_total_count)
```

::: callout-caution
To calculate an aggregated value for a variable like median household income, which depends on the distribution of the underling data, it may be worth considering whether a weighed average value is an appropriate measure. In some cases, it may be more appropriate to use the counts in each income bracket to estimate a median income, and/or present the income distribution rather than a single value.

For a discussion of the problem and a proposed solution, see [this document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6165014-How-to-Recalculate-a-Median.html#document/p1).

### Interpolation Step 3: Aggregate by Water System

Next, we need to combine the weighted values calculated above to produce the estimates for each water system, and can also use those combined values to compute some additional metrics for each system (like rates, income distributions, etc.).

#### Combine Results by Water System

First, combine the results by summing all of the count-based variables (derived from areal interpolation), and calculating weighted averages for all variables computed in step 2 above. Note that we have to first calculate the denominator for each variable calculated with population weighted interpolation, because some of those variables contain missing values for records where the denominator is present (and if we don't remove the missing values, we get an `NA` for any water system that contains a block group with a missing value for that variable). For example, there are block groups where the median household income is missing, but the total household count is available for that block group – in that case, the weighted average should not include the households in that block group in the denominator; otherwise, the true value will be underestimated.

```{r}
water_system_demographics <- census_data_interpolate %>% 
    group_by(WATER_SY_1) %>% 
    mutate(
        average_household_size_denominator = if_else(is.na(average_household_size), 0, households_count),
        median_household_income_denominator = if_else(is.na(median_household_income), 0, households_count),
        per_capita_income_denominator = if_else(is.na(per_capita_income), 0, population_total_count)
    ) %>% 
    summarize(
        across(
            .cols = ends_with('_count'),
            .fns = ~ sum(.x)
        ),
        average_household_size_hh_weighted = 
            sum(average_household_size_weighted, na.rm = TRUE) / 
            sum(average_household_size_denominator),
        median_household_income_hh_weighted = 
            sum(median_household_income_weighted, na.rm = TRUE) /
            sum(median_household_income_denominator),
        per_capita_income_pop_weighted = 
            sum(per_capita_income_weighted, na.rm = TRUE) / 
            sum(per_capita_income_denominator)
    ) %>% 
    ungroup()
```

#### Check - Count Variables Estimated with Areal Interpolation {#sec-check-areal-interp}

As noted above, it's also possible to use pre-built functions for areal interpolation. This section demonstrates those functions and uses them as a check of our computed count data.

From the `sf` package, we can use the `st_interpolate_aw` function:

```{r}
#| warning: false

# NOTE: it's only necessary to check the estimated values for one variable - 
# this just checks the total estimated population

# sf package
check_sf <- st_interpolate_aw(x = census_data_acs %>% 
                                  select(population_total_count),
                       to = water_systems_sac,
                       extensive = TRUE) %>% 
    bind_cols(water_systems_sac %>% st_drop_geometry)

# check - should be TRUE if results are equivalent
all(check_sf %>% 
        arrange(WATER_SY_1) %>% 
        pull(population_total_count) %>% 
        round(5) ==
    water_system_demographics %>% 
        arrange(WATER_SY_1) %>% 
        pull(population_total_count) %>% 
        round(5)
)
```

From the `areal` package, we can use the `aw_interpolate` function. Note that there are some settings that you may need to modify in the `aw_interpolate` function depending on the type of analysis you're doing. In particular, for more information about the `weight` argument -- which can be either `sum` or `total` -- see [this section of the documentation](https://chris-prener.github.io/areal/articles/areal-weighted-interpolation.html#calculating-weights-for-extensive-interpolations). For more information about extensive versus intensive interpolations, see [this section of the documenation](https://chris-prener.github.io/areal/articles/areal-weighted-interpolation.html#extensive-and-intensive-interpolations) (as noted above, the method applied here avoids using areal interpolation to calculate intensive variables, because area may not be a good metric for determining how to weight those variables, considering that we can estimate associated counts for populations/households/etc.).

```{r}
#| warning: false

# NOTE: it's only necessary to check the estimated values for one variable - 
# this just checks the total estimated population

# areal package
check_areal <- aw_interpolate(water_systems_sac,
                              tid = WATER_SY_1,
                              source = census_data_acs,
                              sid = GEOID,
                              weight = 'total',
                              extensive = c('population_total_count'))

# check - should be TRUE if results are equivalent
all(check_areal %>% 
        arrange(WATER_SY_1) %>% 
        pull(population_total_count) %>% 
        round(5) ==
    water_system_demographics %>% 
        arrange(WATER_SY_1) %>% 
        pull(population_total_count) %>% 
        round(5)
)
```

#### Clean & Format Results {#sec-results-clean}

We could stop here, and save the dataset containing the results to an output file (done below - see @sec-results-save). But, it may be useful to do some additional computations and re-formatting before saving the dataset. For example, in this case it may be useful to calculate the racial/ethnic breakdown of each system's population as percentages of the total population (in addition to the total counts computed above), and calculate other rates / distributions.

First we can add fields with each racial/ethnic group's estimated percent of the total population within each water system's service area:

```{r}
water_system_demographics <- water_system_demographics %>%
    mutate(
        across(
            .cols = starts_with('population_'),
            .fns = ~ round(.x / population_total_count * 100, 2),
            .names = "{str_replace(.col, '_count', '_percent')}"
        ),
        .after = population_other_or_multiple_count) %>% 
    select(-population_total_percent) # this always equals 1, not needed
```

We can also calculate the estimated poverty rate for each water system's service area.

```{r}
water_system_demographics <- water_system_demographics %>% 
    mutate(poverty_rate_percent = case_when(
        poverty_total_assessed_count == 0 ~ 0,
        .default = 100 * poverty_below_count / poverty_total_assessed_count
    ), 
    .after = poverty_above_count)
```

And compute income brackets in 25k increments:

```{r}
water_system_demographics <- water_system_demographics %>% 
    mutate(households_income_0_25k_count = 
               households_income_below_10k_count + 
               households_income_10k_15k_count + 
               households_income_15k_20k_count +
               households_income_20k_25k_count,
           households_income_25k_50k_count =
               households_income_25k_30k_count + 
               households_income_30k_35k_count +
               households_income_35k_40k_count +
               households_income_40k_45k_count +
               households_income_45k_50k_count,
           households_income_50k_75k_count =
               households_income_50k_60k_count +
               households_income_60k_75k_count,
           .after = households_income_above_200k_count
    ) # note - above 75k is already in 25k increments
```

And compute income brackets in 50k increments:

```{r}
water_system_demographics <- water_system_demographics %>% 
    mutate(households_income_0_50k_count = 
               households_income_0_25k_count + 
               households_income_25k_50k_count,
           households_income_50k_100k_count =
               households_income_50k_75k_count +
               households_income_75k_100k_count,
           households_income_100k_150k_count =
               households_income_100k_125k_count +
               households_income_125k_150k_count,
           .after = households_income_50k_75k_count
    ) # above 150k is already in 50k increments
```

And compute grouped median household income:

```{r}

```

And compute \# and % of households below income thresholds:

```{r}

```

And, compute the portion of households paying more than 30% / 50% of their income toward housing costs:

```{r}
water_system_demographics <- water_system_demographics %>%
    mutate(households_percent_housing_costs_above_30_percent = 
               100 * (households_mortgage_over30pct_count + 
                          households_no_mortgage_over30pct_count +
                          households_rent_over30pct_count) / 
               households_count) %>% 
    mutate(households_percent_housing_costs_above_50_percent = 
               100 * (households_mortgage_over50pct_count + 
                          households_no_mortgage_over50pct_count +
                          households_rent_over50pct_count) / 
               households_count)
```

Finally, we can round the estimated values to appropriate levels of precision:

```{r}
water_system_demographics <- water_system_demographics %>%
    mutate(
        across(
            .cols = ends_with('_count'),
            .fns = ~ round(.x, 0)
        ))  %>%
    mutate(
        across(
            .cols = ends_with('_percent'),
            .fns = ~ round(.x, 2)
        ))
```

We've now got a dataset with the selected census data estimated for each of the *target* geographic features (water system service areas). Here's a view of the contents and structure of the re-formatted dataset (only the first few fields are shown):

```{r}
glimpse(water_system_demographics[,1:20])
```

@tbl-water-sys-demographics-rev provides a complete view of the cleaned and re-formatted dataset. These results are saved locally in tabular and spatial format in @sec-results-save.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-water-sys-demographics-rev
#| tbl-cap: "Water System Demographics"
#| tbl-cap-location: top

water_system_demographics %>%
    kable(caption = 'A Caption') %>%
    scroll_box(height = "400px")
```

#### Transform Results to Long Format {#sec-results-transform-long}

For further analysis and exploration / visualization of the results, it will help to convert the results from wide to long format, and edit the group names so that they can be used as titles.

```{r}

# pivot from wide to long format
water_system_demographics_long <- water_system_demographics %>% 
    # select(WATER_SY_1, starts_with('percent_')) %>% # select only the fields with percentages, and the water system name/id
    # convert to long format
    # st_drop_geometry() %>% 
    pivot_longer(cols = !c(WATER_SY_1, geometry), 
                 names_to = 'variable', 
                 values_to = 'value')

# clean variable names and add grouping fields (type, group_type)
water_system_demographics_long <- water_system_demographics_long %>% 
    mutate(variable = variable %>% 
               # str_remove_all(pattern = 'percent_') %>% 
               str_replace_all(pattern = '_', replacement = ' ') %>% 
               str_replace_all(pattern = ' or ', replacement = ' / ') %>% 
               str_to_title(.) %>% 
               str_remove_all(pattern = ' / Alaska Native')) %>% 
    mutate(type = case_when(
        str_detect(variable, pattern = 'Count') ~ 'Count',
        str_detect(variable, pattern = 'Percent') ~ 'Percent',
        str_detect(variable, pattern = 'Pop Weighted') ~ 'Pop Weighted',
        str_detect(variable, pattern = 'Hh Weighted') ~ 'Hh Weighted',
        .default = NA), 
        .after = variable) %>% 
    mutate(group_type = case_when(
        str_detect(variable, pattern ='Population') ~ 'Population',
        str_detect(variable, pattern = 'Households') ~ 'Households',
        str_detect(variable, pattern = 'Average Household Size Hh Weighted') ~ 'Household Weighted', 
        str_detect(variable, pattern = 'Median Household Income Hh Weighted') ~ 'Household Weighted',
        str_detect(variable, pattern = 'Per Capita Income Pop Weighted') ~ 'Population Weighted',
        str_detect(variable, pattern = 'Poverty') ~ 'Population'),
        .after = type) %>% 
    mutate(variable = case_when(
        str_detect(variable, pattern = 'Households Count') ~ 'Households Total',
        .default = str_remove_all(variable, pattern = 'Households'))) %>% 
    mutate(variable = case_when(
        str_detect(variable, 'Population Total Count') ~ 'Population Total',
        .default = str_remove_all(variable, 'Population'))) %>%
    mutate(variable = str_remove_all(variable, 
                                     pattern = 'Count')) %>% 
    mutate(variable = str_remove_all(variable, 
                                     pattern = 'Percent')) %>% 
    mutate(variable = str_remove_all(variable, 
                                     pattern = ' Hh Weighted')) %>% 
    mutate(variable = str_remove_all(variable, 
                                     pattern = ' Pop Weighted')) %>% 
    mutate(variable = str_replace_all(variable, 
                                      pattern = 'Over30pct', 
                                      replacement = 'Over 30% Income')) %>% 
    mutate(variable = str_replace_all(variable, 
                                      pattern = 'Over50pct', 
                                      replacement = 'Over 50% Income')) %>% 
    mutate(variable = str_trim(variable)) %>%
    mutate(variable = str_replace_all(variable,
                                      pattern = 'k ',
                                      replacement = 'k-')) %>%
    mutate(variable = str_replace_all(variable,
                                      pattern = '0 ',
                                      replacement = '0-'))
```

Here's a view of the structure of the reformatted data:

```{r}
glimpse(water_system_demographics_long)
```

### Save Results {#sec-results-save}

Once we've finished the computations and verified the outputs look reasonable, we can save the results to output files so they can be re-used and shared. The results can be saved in tabular (e.g., csv, excel) and/or spatial (e.g., shapefile, geopackage) formats, which may be helpful for different use cases. Note that you may need to think about exactly what variables to include in the output file(s) and how to format the output datasets (e.g., wide versus long format).

The chunk of code below (which is hidden by default), just tests to see whether any of the datasets to be saved have been changed since the previous version was saved. In general this is probably not needed for a typical workflow and can be ignored for most use cases -- it is just used here to make rendering of this document a little more efficient.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# compute hash for datasets to be saved (i.e., a unique identifier for each dataset), and compare against previous versions

## define file that stores hash (unique identifier for dataset)
hash_file <- here('03_data_results',
                  'dataset_hash.csv')

## compute hashes (unique identifier for datasets)
hash_current <- digest(object = water_system_demographics,
                       algo = 'md5')
hash_current_long <- digest(object = water_system_demographics_long,
                            algo = 'md5')
hash_table_current <- tibble(dataset = c('water_system_demographics', 'water_system_demographics_long'),
                             hash = c(hash_current, hash_current_long))

## get the previous hashes from file (if it exists), else create a new file to store the hashes
if (file.exists(hash_file)) {
    hash_table_previous <- read_csv(file = hash_file)
} else {
    file.create(hash_file)
    hash_table_previous <- tibble(dataset = c('water_system_demographics', 'water_system_demographics_long'),
                             hash = c('missing', 'missing'))
}

## if new hash is different from previous hash, set flag to update the output file (i.e., write a new version of the file)
file_update <- !identical(hash_table_current %>% 
                              filter(dataset == 'water_system_demographics') %>% 
                              pull(hash),
                          hash_table_previous %>% 
                              filter(dataset == 'water_system_demographics') %>% 
                              pull(hash))
file_update_long <- !identical(hash_table_current %>% 
                                   filter(dataset == 'water_system_demographics_long') %>% 
                                   pull(hash),
                               hash_table_previous %>% 
                                   filter(dataset == 'water_system_demographics_long') %>% 
                                   pull(hash))

## write current hashes to file (for comparison with future versions)
write_csv(x = hash_table_current,
          file = hash_file,
          append = FALSE)
```

#### Tabular Dataset {#sec-results-save-tabular}

The code below saves the tabular results to a csv file -- note that this dataset is in the 'wide' format we originally produced the results in:

```{r}
#| cache: false

if (file_update == TRUE) {
    write_csv(water_system_demographics %>%
                  st_drop_geometry(), # drop the spatial data since this is a tabular format
              file = here('03_data_results',
                          'water_system_demographics_sac.csv'))
}
```

We can also save the data in the long/tidy format we developed above:

```{r}
#| cache: false

if (file_update_long == TRUE) {
    write_csv(water_system_demographics_long %>%
                  st_drop_geometry(), # drop the spatial data since this is a tabular format
              file = here('03_data_results',
                          'water_system_demographics_sac_long.csv'))
}
```

#### Spatial Dataset {#sec-results-save-spatial}

To save the output in a geospatial format, it may be best to save the data in a wide format, so that all of the attribute data for each *target* area (water system) is in a single row along with its spatial data (i.e. the system boundary information) (saving in long format may create a very large file). The code below saves the results -- in wide format -- to a geopackage file, which is a spatial file format that is similar to a shapefile.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: hide
#| cache: false

if (file_update == TRUE) {
    st_write(water_system_demographics,
             here('03_data_results',
                  'water_system_demographics_sac.gpkg'),
             append = FALSE)
}
```

## Explore and Visualize Results {#sec-results-explore}

::: callout-warning
This section is in progress...
:::

For simplicity, this section will focus on presenting estimated demographics for some of the largest water suppliers in the Sacramento county region (results for small water systems may not be very accurate and should be used with some caution - see @sec-check-pop-estimated-reported and @sec-small-area-estimates for more investigation of the results for small systems).

\[TO DO: add visualizations\]

Prepare interpolation data

```{r}
# census_data_interpolate  census_data_clip
census_data_interpolate <- census_data_interpolate %>% 
    mutate(households_percent_housing_costs_above_30_percent = 
               100 * (households_mortgage_over30pct_count + 
                          households_no_mortgage_over30pct_count +
                          households_rent_over30pct_count) / 
               households_count) %>% 
    mutate(households_percent_housing_costs_above_50_percent = 
               100 * (households_mortgage_over50pct_count + 
                          households_no_mortgage_over50pct_count +
                          households_rent_over50pct_count) / 
               households_count)
```

Select systems to plot

```{r}

## Check - Estimated vs Reported Population Estimates {#sec-check-pop-estimated-reported}

\[TO DO: Create map\]

Based on the map above, it's apparent that it will be difficult to obtain reasonable estimates for some suppliers, such as the suppliers with very small service areas in the southern portion of the county where the block groups are very large (and the supplier's service are is only a small fraction of the total area of the block group). These issues are explored further in @sec-small-area-estimates.

Note that there are a number of reasons why the estimated population values are likely to differ from the population numbers in the water system dataset (e.g., the depicted boundaries may not be correct or exact, the supplier may have used different methods to count/estimate the population they serve, the time frames for the estimates may be different, etc.). But, there may also be some cases where the numbers differ significantly -- depending on the actual analysis being performed, this may mean that further work is needed for certain areas, or could mean that this method may not be sufficient and different methods are needed.

As a check, we can add a column to the interpolated dataset (which we'll call `population_percent_difference`) to compute the difference between the estimated total population (in the `population_total` field) and the total population listed in the `POPULATION` field (the reported value from the water system dataset).

```{r}

water_system_demographics <- water_system_demographics %>% 
    left_join(water_systems_sac %>% 
                  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
                  select(WATER_SY_1, POPULATION),
              by = 'WATER_SY_1')

water_system_demographics <- water_system_demographics %>%
    mutate(population_percent_difference =
               round(100 * (population_total_count - POPULATION) / POPULATION, 
                     2), 
           .after = POPULATION)
```

For water systems with a small population and/or service area, the estimated demographics may not match the reported population numbers in the water system dataset very well. You can see this in @tbl-pop-est-small by comparing the `population_reported` field, which contains the total population values from the water supplier dataset, with the `population_estimated` field, which contains the total population estimated from the census data; the difference between the two is summarized in the `population_percent_difference` field. This probably indicates that, for small areas, some adjustments and/or further analysis may be needed, and the preliminary estimated values should be treated with some caution/skepticism.

Note: See @sec-small-area-estimates below for some more investigation into water systems whose estimated population is at or near zero.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-pop-est-small
#| tbl-cap: "10 Smallest Water Systems by Population"

water_system_demographics %>%
    arrange(POPULATION) %>%
    slice(1:10) %>%
    select(WATER_SY_1, population_reported = POPULATION, 
           population_estimated = population_total_count, 
           population_percent_difference) %>%
    st_drop_geometry() %>%
    kable()
```

But for larger water systems, the estimated population values seem to be more in line with the population numbers in the original dataset. You can see this in @tbl-pop-est-large by, as above, comparing the `population_reported` field, which contains the total population values from the water supplier dataset, with the `population_estimated` field, which contains the total population estimated from the census data; the difference between the two is summarized in the `population_percent_difference` field.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-pop-est-large
#| tbl-cap: "10 Largest Water Systems by Population"

water_system_demographics %>%
    arrange(desc(POPULATION)) %>%
    slice(1:10) %>%
    select(WATER_SY_1, population_reported = POPULATION, 
           population_estimated = population_total_count, 
           population_percent_difference) %>%
    st_drop_geometry() %>%
    kable()
```

## Considerations for Detailed Population Estimates {#sec-detailed-pop-estimates}

::: callout-warning
This section is in progress...
:::

If you're primarily only interested in population estimates (possibly including population by race/ethnicity, age, gender, etc.) and need an estimate that's as geographically accurate as possible, it may make more sense to use the block-level population data from the decennial census rather than block group level population data from the ACS. However, since the decennial census only occurs once every 10 years, those estimates won't reflect recent population changes (and will get especially less accurate as we get farther from the last decennial census). But keep in mind that even the 5-year ACS is an average that encompasses previous years' estimates, so it's not necessarily temporally precise either.

It's also possible to use the block-level decennial population data as a weighing factor for ACS population data (to allocate the population within block-group level ACS data).

\[TO DO: add example\]

## Considerations for Small / Rural Area Estimates {#sec-small-area-estimates}

::: callout-warning
This section is in progress...
:::

For some water systems, the estimated population using the areal interpolation above (@sec-areal-interp) was at or near zero, and it may be useful to look at an example to see what's going on with one of those cases.

(because the water system may encompass only a small portion of one or a few census units, and the entire census unit(s) may not be representative of the small portion(s)), especially those in rural environments (where population densities are lower, population centers tend to be spread out, and census units tend to be larger).

\[TO DO: insert map\]

From the map above \[TO DO: insert map\], you can see that the service area reported for some systems are very small, only covering a small fraction of a single census unit, resulting in a population estimate that is very low. In these cases, it could be that the system area was drawn incorrectly (i.e., maybe it doesn't really depict the entire service area), in which case the reported service area should be revised. Or, it's possible that the population within the given census unit is very un-evenly distributed and instead there's a relatively high density population cluster in the depicted service area, in which case a more sophisticated method than an area-weighted average should be used (e.g., maybe consider the density of buildings, roads, and/or other features associated with inhabited areas).

## Alternative Computation Methods {#sec-alternative-methods}

::: callout-warning
This section is in progress...

### Population Weighted Interpolation {#sec-alternative-interpolate_pw}

The `tidycensus` package also has a function for population weighted interpolation, [`interpolate_pw`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/reference/interpolate_pw.html), but it uses a somewhat different methodology than the population weighted interpolation procedure applied above in @sec-pop-interp.

Note that some water systems may not get an estimated value using this method, even if `NA` values are removed from the source data first (TO DO: check whether this depends on which type of boundary dataset is used - i.e., tigris with cb = FALSE or TRUE).

Using original `census_data_acs` variable gives multiple `NA`s - it looks like those are small areas:

```{r}
results_interpolate_pw <- interpolate_pw(from = census_data_acs %>%
                                             filter(!is.na(population_total_count)) %>% # population_total_count  median_household_income
                                             select(population_total_count),
                                         to = water_systems_sac,
                                         to_id = 'WATER_SY_1',
                                         extensive = TRUE, # use FALSE for median_household_income
                                         weights = census_data_decennial,
                                         # weight_placement = 'surface',
                                         weight_column = 'population_total_count') %>%
    # rename(median_household_income_interpolate_pw = median_household_income) # rename results field
    rename(population_total_count_interpolate_pw = population_total_count) %>% 
    mutate(population_total_count_interpolate_pw = round(population_total_count_interpolate_pw, 0))

# sum(is.na(results_interpolate_pw$median_household_income_interpolate_pw))
sum(is.na(results_interpolate_pw$population_total_count_interpolate_pw))
```

#                                                       select(population_total_count),
#                                                   to = water_systems_sac,
#                                                   to_id = 'WATER_SY_1',
#                                                   extensive = TRUE, # use FALSE for median_household_income
#                                                   weights = census_data_decennial,
#                                                   weight_placement = 'surface',
#                                                   weight_column = 'population_total_count') %>%
#     # rename(median_household_income_interpolate_pw = median_household_income) # rename results field
#     rename(population_total_count_interpolate_pw = population_total_count)
# 
# # sum(is.na(results_interpolate_pw_detailed$median_household_income_interpolate_pw))
# sum(is.na(results_interpolate_pw_detailed$population_total_count_interpolate_pw))
```

Compare results using `interpolate_pw` to reported population counts:

```{r}
results_interpolate_pw <- results_interpolate_pw %>%
    left_join(water_systems_sac %>%
                  st_drop_geometry() %>%
                  select(SERVICE_CO, POPULATION, WATER_SY_1),
              by = 'WATER_SY_1') %>% 
    relocate(POPULATION, .after = population_total_count_interpolate_pw)

## Working with Other Source Datasets {#sec-other-sources}

::: callout-warning
This section is in progress...
:::

In addition to using census data, it's possible to use other types of *source* datasets to compute characteristics of custom *target* areas like water systems. The process is generally likely to be similar to the processes shown above using census data, but each source dataset may require unique considerations (e.g., to handle missing values, uncertain boundaries, etc.).

### CalEnviroScreen {#sec-calenviroscreen}

\[TO DO: compute population weighted average scores, using interpolated population estimates - (1) first compute interpolated populations by clipping ACS tracts to CES boundaries, then (2) clip those boundaries to water systems and compute populations, then (3) calculate population weighted averages (using areal-weighted populations from step 2)?\]

Notes to consider:

-   Some census tracts are missing CES scores (overall and/or for certain indicators), and have to deal with those missing values somehow

-   CES 4.0 is tract-level data, and uses 2010 census boundaries (so boundaries won't match current ACS boundaries)
