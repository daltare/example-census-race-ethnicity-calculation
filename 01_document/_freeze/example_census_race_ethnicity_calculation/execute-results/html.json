It also provides some brief background on the various types of data available from the U.S Census Bureau, and links to a few places to find more in-depth information.\n\nThis particular example estimates demographic characteristics of community water systems in the Sacramento County area (the *target* dataset). It uses the [`tidycensus`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html) R package [@tidycensus] to access selected demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau (the *source* dataset) for census units whose spatial extent covers those water systems' service areas, then uses the [`areal`](https://chris-prener.github.io/areal/) R package [@areal] to estimate some demographic characteristics of each water system based on that census data. It also relies on a number of other R packages, such as the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) collection of packages [@tidyverse] for general data management and analysis, and the [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package [@sf] for working with spatial data.\n\nThis example is just intended to be a simplified demonstration of a possible workflow. For a real analysis, additional steps and considerations -- that may not be covered here -- may be needed to deal with data inconsistencies (e.g., missing or incomplete data), required level of precision and acceptable assumptions (e.g. more fine-grained datasets or more sophisticated techniques could be used to estimate/model population distributions), or other project-specific issues that might arise.\n\n## Setup {#sec-setup}\n\nThe code block below loads required packages for this analysis, and sets some user-defined options and defaults. If they aren't already installed on your computer, you can install them with the R command `install.packages('package-name')` (and replace `package-name` with the name of the package you want to install).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# packages ----\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(tigris)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(units)\nlibrary(areal)\nlibrary(Polychrome)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(digest)\nlibrary(mapview)\n\n# conflicts ----\nlibrary(conflicted)\nconflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)\n\n# options ----\noptions(scipen = 999) # turn off scientific notation\noptions(tigris_use_cache = TRUE) # use data caching for tigris\n\n# reference system ----\ncrs_projected <- 3310 # set a common projected coordinate reference system to be used throughout this analysis - see: https://epsg.io/3310\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Census Data Overview {#sec-census-overview}\n\nThis section provides some brief background on the various types of data available from the U.S. Census Bureau (a later section - @sec-census-access - demonstrates how to retrieve data from the U.S. Census Bureau using the [`tidycensus`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html) R package). Most of the information covered here comes from the book [Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html), which is a great source of information if you'd like more detail about any of the topics below [@walker2023].\n\n::: callout-note\nIf you're already familiar with Census data and want to skip this overview, go directly to the next section: @sec-system-boundaries\n:::\n\nDifferent census products/surveys contain data on different variables, at different geographic scales, over varying periods of time, and with varying levels of certainty. Therefore, there are a number of judgement calls to make when determining which type of census data to use for an analysis -- e.g., which data product to use (Decennial Census or American Community Survey), which geographic scale to use (e.g., Block, Block Group, Tract, etc.), what time frame to use, which variables to assess, etc.\n\nMore detailed information about U.S. Census Bureau's data products and other topics mentioned below is available [here](https://walker-data.com/census-r/the-united-states-census-and-the-r-programming-language.html#the-united-states-census-and-the-r-programming-language).\n\n### Census Unit Geography / Hierarchy {#sec-census-hierarchy}\n\nPublicly available datasets from the U.S Census Bureau generally consist of individual survey responses aggregated to defined census units (e.g., census tracts) that cover varying geographic scales. Some of these units are nested and can be neatly aggregated (e.g., each census tract is composed of a collection of block groups, and each block group is composed of a collection of blocks), while other census units are outside this hierarchy (e.g., Zip Code Tabulation Areas don't coincide with any other census unit). @fig-census-hierarchies shows the relationship of all of the various census units.\n\nCommonly used census statistical units like tracts and block groups have target population size ranges, and can be adjusted every 10 years (with the decennial census) based on population changes. For example, all ACS 5-year datasets prior to 2020 use the 2010 boundaries for tracts, block groups, and blocks, and all ACS 5-year datasets from [2020 onward](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2020/geography-changes.html) (presumably through 2029) use the 2020 boundaries for those units. [Census tracts](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_13) are generally around 4,000 people, with a range from about 1,200 to 8,000, and [block groups](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_4) generally contain 600 to 3,000 people. [Blocks](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_5) are the smallest census units, and are \"areas bounded by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by nonvisible boundaries, such as selected property lines and city, township, school district, and county limits and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads\". For example, a census block may be \"a city block bounded on all sides by streets\", while \"blocks in suburban and rural areas may be larger, more irregular in shape, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads, streams, and transmission lines\".\n\n::: callout-caution\nCensus boundaries can change over time. Commonly used statistical units like tracts, block groups, and blocks tend to be revised every 10 years (with the decennial census), so it's important to use a census boundary dataset that matches the version of the census demographic data you're retrieving; otherwise, the demographic data may not match geographic areas in your boundary dataset. In some cases, a census unit that exists in a given year of the census data may not exist at all in a different year's dataset, because census units can be split or merged when boundaries are revised.\n\nFor more information, see [here](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/acs/acs_geography_handbook_2020_ch02.pdf) or [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/geography-acs/geography-boundaries-by-year.html) or [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_6) or [here](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/data-gems/2021/compare-2020-census-and-2010-census-redistricting-data.html).\n:::\n\nFor a list of the different geographic units available for each of the different census products/surveys (see @sec-census-datasets) that can be accessed via the `tidycensus` package, go [here](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html#geography-in-tidycensus).\n\n![Census Unit Hierarchies](https://walker-data.com/census-r/img/screenshots/census-hierarchies.png){#fig-census-hierarchies}\n\n### Census Datasets / Surveys {#sec-census-datasets}\n\nThe Decennial Census is conducted every 10 years, and is intended to provide a complete count of the US population and assist with political redistricting. As a result, it collects a relatively limited set of basic demographic data, but (should) provide a high degree of precision (i.e., in general it should provide exact counts). It is available for geographic units down to the census block (the smallest census unit available -- see @sec-census-hierarchy). For information about existing and planned future releases of 2020 census data products, go [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/planning-management/release/about-2020-data-products.html).\n\nThe American Community Survey (ACS) provides a much larger array of demographic information than the Decennial Census, and is updated more frequently. The ACS is based on a sample of the population (rather than a count of the entire population, as in the Decennial Census), so it represents estimated values rather than precise counts; therefore, each data point is available as an estimate (typically labeled with an \"E\" in census variable codes, which are discussed in @sec-census-variables ) along with an associated margin of error (typically labeled with \"M\" or \"MOE\" in census variable codes) around its estimated value.\n\nThe ACS is available in two formats. The 5-year ACS is a rolling average of 5 years of data (e.g., the 2021 5-year ACS dataset is an average of the ACS data from 2017 through 2021), and is generally available for geographic units down to the census block group (though some 5-year ACS data may only be available at less granular levels). The 1-year ACS provides data for a single year, and is only available for geographies with population greater than 65,000 (e.g., large cities and counties). Therefore, only the 5-year ACS will be useful for any analysis at a relatively fine scale (e.g., anything that requires data at or more detailed than the census tract level, or any analysis that considers smaller counties/cities -- by definition, census tracts always contain significantly fewer than 65,000 people).\n\nIn addition to the Decennial Census and ACS data, a number of other census data products/surveys are also available. For example, see the `censusapi` R package ([here](https://github.com/hrecht/censusapi) or [here](https://www.hrecht.com/censusapi/index.html)) for access to over 300 census API endpoints. For historical census data, see the discussion [here](https://walker-data.com/census-r/other-census-and-government-data-resources.html?q=API%20endpoint#other-census-and-government-data-resources) on using NHGIS, IPUMS, and the `ipumsr` package.\n\n### Census Variables / Codes {#sec-census-variables}\n\nEach census product collects data for many different demographic variables, and each variable is generally associated with an identifier code. In order to access census data programmatically, you often need to know the code associated with each variable of interest. When determining which variables to use, you need to consider what census product contains those variables (see @sec-census-datasets) and how they differ in terms of time frame, precision, spatial granularity (see @sec-census-hierarchy), etc.\n\nThe `tidycensus` package offers a convenient generic way to search for variables across different census products using the `load_variables()` function, as described [here](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html#searching-for-variables).\n\nThe following websites may also be helpful for exploring the various census data products and finding the variable names and codes they contain:\n\n-   Census Reporter (for ACS data): <https://censusreporter.org/> (especially <https://censusreporter.org/topics/table-codes/>)\n\n-   Census Bureau's list of variable codes, e.g.:\n\n    -   2020 Census codes: <https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/pl/variables.html>\n\n    -   2022 ACS 5 year codes: <https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5/variables.html>\n\n-   Census Bureau's data interface (for Decennial Census and ACS, and other census datasets): <https://data.census.gov/cedsci/>\n\n-   National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) (for ACS data and historical decennial Census data): <https://www.nhgis.org/>\n\n\n## Target Data Boundaries (Water Systems) {#sec-system-boundaries}\n\nIn this section, we'll get the service area boundaries for Community Water Systems within the Sacramento County area. This will serve as the *target* dataset – i.e., the set of areas which we'll be estimating the characteristics of – and will also be used to specifying what census data we want to retrieve. We'll also get a dataset of county boundaries which overlap the water service areas in this study, which can also help with specifying what census data to access and/or with making maps and visualizations.\n\n### Read Water System Data\n\nIn this case, we'll get the water system dataset from a shapefile that's saved locally, then transform that dataset into a common coordinate reference system for mapping and analysis (which is defined above in the variable `crs_projected`).\n\nThis water system dataset comes from the [California Drinking Water System Area Boundaries dataset](https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/home/item.html?id=fbba842bf134497c9d611ad506ec48cc). For this example, the dataset has been pre-filtered for systems within Sacramento County (by selecting records where the `COUNTY` field is \"SACRAMENTO\") and for Community Water Systems (by selecting records where the `STATE_CLAS` field is \"COMMUNITY\"). Some un-needed fields have also been dropped, remaining fields have been re-orderd.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwater_systems_sac <- st_read(here('02_data_input', \n                                  'water_supplier_boundaries_sac', \n                                  'System_Area_Boundary_Layer_Sac.shp')) %>% \n    st_transform(crs_projected) # transform to common coordinate system\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can use the `glimpse` function (below) to take get a sense of what type of information is available in the water system dataset and how it's structured.\n\nNote that this dataset already includes a `POPULATION` variable that indicates the population served by each water system. However, for this analysis we'll be making our own estimate of the population within each system's service area based on U.S. Census Bureau data and the spatial representation of the system boundaries. I don't know exactly how the `POPULATION` variable was derived in this dataset, and it likely will not exactly match the population estimates from this analysis, but may serve as a useful check to make sure our estimates are reasonable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(water_systems_sac)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 62\nColumns: 12\n$ WATER_SY_1 <chr> \"HOOD WATER MAINTENCE DIST [SWS]\", \"MC CLELLAN MHP\", \"MAGNO…\n$ WATER_SYST <chr> \"CA3400101\", \"CA3400179\", \"CA3400130\", \"CA3400135\", \"CA3400…\n$ GLOBALID   <chr> \"{36268DB3-9DB2-4305-A85A-2C3A85F20F34}\", \"{E3BF3C3E-D516-4…\n$ BOUNDARY_T <chr> \"Water Service Area\", \"Water Service Area\", \"Water Service …\n$ OWNER_TYPE <chr> \"L\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\",…\n$ COUNTY     <chr> \"SACRAMENTO\", \"SACRAMENTO\", \"SACRAMENTO\", \"SACRAMENTO\", \"SA…\n$ REGULATING <chr> \"LPA64 - SACRAMENTO COUNTY\", \"LPA64 - SACRAMENTO COUNTY\", \"…\n$ FEDERAL_CL <chr> \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUN…\n$ STATE_CLAS <chr> \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUNITY\", \"COMMUN…\n$ SERVICE_CO <dbl> 82, 199, 34, 64, 128, 83, 28, 50, 164, 5684, 14798, 115, 33…\n$ POPULATION <dbl> 100, 700, 40, 150, 256, 150, 32, 100, 350, 18005, 44928, 20…\n$ geometry   <MULTIPOLYGON [m]> MULTIPOLYGON (((-132703 403..., MULTIPOLYGON (…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Alternative Data Retrieval Method\n\nReading in data from a shapefile is shown above because it's likely one of the more common ways that users will access their *target* boundary data. However, depending on the dataset, there may be other ways to access the data. For example, the code chunk below demonstrates an alternative -- using the [`arcgislayers`](https://r.esri.com/arcgislayers/index.html) package [@arcgislayers] -- that connects directly to the source dataset (to retrieve the most recent version) and applies the filters needed to reproduce the dataset in the `System_Area_Boundary_Layer_Sac.shp` file. Note that this code is not actually used; it is just presented here for reference.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load arcgislayers package (see: https://r.esri.com/arcgislayers/index.html)\ninstall.packages('pak') # only needed if the pak package is not already installed\npak::pkg_install(\"R-ArcGIS/arcgislayers\", dependencies = TRUE)\n\nlibrary(arcgislayers)\n\n# define link to data source\nurl_feature <- 'https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portalserver/rest/services/Drinking_Water/California_Drinking_Water_System_Area_Boundaries/FeatureServer/0'\n\n# connect to data source\nwater_systems_feature_layer <- arc_open(url_feature)\n\n# download and filter data from source\nwater_systems_sac <- arc_select(\n  water_systems_feature_layer,\n  # apply filters\n  where = \"COUNTY = 'SACRAMENTO' AND STATE_CLASSIFICATION = 'COMMUNITY'\",\n  # select fields\n  fields = c('WATER_SYSTEM_NAME', 'WATER_SYSTEM_NUMBER', 'GLOBALID',\n             'BOUNDARY_TYPE', 'OWNER_TYPE_CODE', 'COUNTY',\n             'REGULATING_AGENCY', 'FEDERAL_CLASSIFICATION', 'STATE_CLASSIFICATION',\n             'SERVICE_CONNECTIONS', 'POPULATION')) %>%\n    # transform to common coordinate system\n    st_transform(crs_projected) %>%\n    # rename fields to match names from the shapefile (which automatically truncates field names)\n    rename(WATER_SY_1 = WATER_SYSTEM_NAME,\n           WATER_SYST = WATER_SYSTEM_NUMBER,\n           BOUNDARY_T = BOUNDARY_TYPE,\n           OWNER_TYPE = OWNER_TYPE_CODE,\n           REGULATING = REGULATING_AGENCY,\n           FEDERAL_CL = FEDERAL_CLASSIFICATION,\n           STATE_CLAS = STATE_CLASSIFICATION,\n           SERVICE_CO = SERVICE_CONNECTIONS)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Get County Boundaries {#sec-county-boundaries}\n\nWhen accessing census data, it may be useful to know which counties overlap the target dataset, as described below in @sec-census-access (note that, even though the dataset is filtered for systems in Sacramento county, there are some systems whose boundaries extend into neighboring counties). County boundaries may also be useful for making maps in later stages of the analysis. We can get a dataset of county boundaries in California from the [TIGER dataset](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html), which can be accessed with R using the [`tigris`](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) R package [@tigris].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncounties_ca <- counties(state = 'CA', \n                        cb = TRUE) %>% #

sections demonstrate how to retrieve census data from the Decennial Census and the ACS using the [`tidycensus`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html) R package.\n\nIn order to use the `tidycensus` R package, you'll need to obtain a personal API key from the US Census Bureau (which is free and available to anyone) by signing up here: <http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>. Once you have your API key, you'll need to register it in R by entering the command `census_api_key(key = \"YOUR API KEY\", install = TRUE)` in the console. Note that the `install = TRUE` argument means that the key is saved for all future R sessions, so you'll only need to run that command once on your computer (rather than including it in your scripts). Alternatively, you could save your key to an environment variable and retrieve it using `Sys.getenv()`. Either way will help you avoid the possibility of entering your API key into any scripts that could be shared publicly.\n\n::: callout-caution\nBecause the boundaries of census units (e.g., tracts, block groups, blocks, etc) can change over time, it's important to make sure that the version (year) of the census data you're retrieving matches the version of the census boundary dataset you're using. The methods shown below retrieve the census boundary dataset together with the census demographic data, which ensures that this won't be a potential problem. However, if you use a different workflow that retrieves the geographic boundaries and demographic data via separate processes, you should ensure that the versions are consistent.\n:::\n\n### Decennial Census {#sec-census-access-decennial}\n\nThis section retrieves census data from the 2020 U.S. Decennial Census, using the `get_decennial` function from the `tidycensus` package. For this example we're getting data at the 'Block Group' level (with the `geography = 'block group'` argument), for the counties defined above in the `counties_list` variable (with the `county = counties_list` argument). By setting the `geometry = TRUE` argument we'll be able to get the spatial data -- i.e., the boundaries of the census block groups -- along with the tabular data defined in the `variables` argument (see @sec-census-variables for information about how to find variable codes). In this case, we're first saving the census variables we want in the `census_vars_decennial` object, and also providing descriptive names associated with each variable code, which makes the data easier to work with later. Also, while by default the `tidycensus` package returns data in long/tidy format, we're getting the data in wide format for this example (by specifying `output = 'wide'`) because it'll be easier to work with for the interpolation method described below to estimate demographics for non-census geographies.\n\nNote that, to the extent possible, using census data at the most granular spatial level should provide the best results when estimating demographics for areas whose boundaries don't align with census unit boundaries. However, depending on the use case, it may require too much time and computational resources to use the most granular spatial data, and may not be necessary to obtain a reasonable estimate. As noted above, in general the most granular level of Decennial Census data available is at the 'Block' level (though Decennial Census data may not be available for all data types at the block level, due to data privacy issues), but this example gets data at the 'Block Group' level for speed and simplicity. Data at the 'Block' level may be a better choice for a real-world analysis if possible.\n\nAlso, as a side note, `tidycensus` returns the Census Bureau's [cartographic boundary shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html) by default (as opposed to the [core TIGER/Line shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html)). Those default cartographic boundary shapefiles are pre-clipped to the US coastline, and are smaller/faster to process (alternatively you can use `cb = FALSE` to get the TIGER/Line data) (see [here](https://walker-data.com/census-r/spatial-analysis-with-us-census-data.html#better-cartography-with-spatial-overlay)). So the default spatial data returned by `tidycensus` may be somewhat different than the default spatial data returned by the `tigris` package, but in general I find it's best to use the default `tidycensus` spatial data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# define variables to pull from the decennial census\ncensus_vars_decennial <- c(\n    'population_hispanic_or_latino' = 'P2_002N', # Total Hispanic or Latino\n                                           'population_white' = 'P2_005N', # White (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'population_black_or_african_american' = 'P2_006N', # Black or African American (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'population_native_american_or_alaska_native' = 'P2_007N', # American Indian and Alaska Native (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'population_asian' = 'P2_008N', # Asian (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'population_pacific_islander' = 'P2_009N', # Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'population_other' = 'P2_010N', # Some other race (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'population_multiple' = 'P2_011N', # Two or more races (Not Hispanic or Latino)\n                                           'population_total' = 'P2_001N'\n)\n\n# get census data\ncensus_data_decennial <- get_decennial(geography = 'block group', # can be 'block', 'block group', 'tract', 'county', etc.\n                                       state = 'CA', \n                                       county = counties_list,\n                                       year = 2020,\n                                       variables = census_vars_decennial,\n                                       output = 'wide', # can be 'wide' or 'tidy'\n                                       geometry = TRUE,\n                                       cache_table = TRUE) \n```\n:::\n\n\nThe output is an sf object (i.e., a dataframe-like object that also includes spatial data), in wide format, where each row represents a census unit, and the population of each racial/ethnic group is reported in a separate column.

For this example, we'll use the 2022 5-year ACS data that we retrieved above (which is saved in the `census_data_acs` variable) as our source of demographic data, and we'll estimate the following for each water system's service area:\n\n-   Population of each racial/ethnic group (using the racial/ethnic categories defined in the census dataset), and each racial/ethnic group's portion of the total service area population\n-   Socio-economic variables like poverty rate, median household income, income distributions, and per capita income\n\nThere are multiple ways this estimation can be done, but one of the most simple and straightforward is using an areal interpolation (essentially an area weighted average). The major simplifying assumption of this approach is that the population or other characteristic(s) of interest are evenly distributed within each unit in the *source* data -- e.g., in this case we're assuming that population (including the total population and the population of each racial/ethic group) and household income is evenly distributed within each census block group.\n\n### Prepare Census Data\n\nTo calculate demographics for the *target* areas, we need to prepare the census data. First, we need to transform the 2022 5-year ACS dataset into the common projected coordinate reference system defined above.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# transform to common coordinate reference system\ncensus_data_acs <- census_data_acs %>% \n    st_transform(crs_projected)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can then apply some transformations to the 2022 5-year ACS dataset prior to performing the areal interpolation to simplify the results and speed the computation.\n\nThis isn't strictly necessary, but we can simplify the census dataset by filtering for census units that overlap with one of the water systems in our dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncensus_data_filter <- census_data_acs %>% \n    st_filter(water_systems_sac, \n              .predicate = st_intersects)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can also drop census units with zero population, since they won't contribute anything to our calculations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## drop census units with zero population\ncensus_data_filter <- census_data_filter %>% \n    filter(population_total > 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou may also want to transform the census data in other ways. For example, we can combine the 'other' and 'multiple' racial/ethnic groupings into one 'other or multiple' racial/ethnic group.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## combine other and multiple\ncensus_data_filter <- census_data_filter %>% \n    mutate('population_other_or_multiple' = population_other + population_multiple, \n           .after = population_pacific_islander) %>% \n    select(-c(population_other, population_multiple))\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere's a view of the contents and structure of the transformed census dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(census_data_filter)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 1,049\nColumns: 43\n$ GEOID                                       <chr> \"060670081451\", \"060670082…\n$ NAME                                        <chr> \"Block Group 1; Census Tra…\n$ population_total                            <dbl> 1768, 1881, 1098, 2748, 17…\n$ population_hispanic_or_latino               <dbl> 38, 327, 376, 782, 366, 17…\n$ population_white                            <dbl> 1627, 1337, 293, 1817, 840…\n$ population_black_or_african_american        <dbl> 0, 1, 272, 26, 351, 111, 1…\n$ population_native_american_or_alaska_native <dbl> 41, 0, 0, 26, 0, 0, 0, 31,…\n$ population_asian                            <dbl> 45, 0, 105, 58, 144, 61, 0…\n$ population_pacific_islander                 <dbl> 0, 98, 0, 0, 27, 13, 0, 0,…\n$ population_other_or_multiple                <dbl> 17, 118, 52, 39, 15, 37, 1…\n$ poverty_total_assessed                      <dbl> 1768, 1847, 1098, 2748, 17…\n$ poverty_below_count                         <dbl> 101, 328, 272, 116, 127, 3…\n$ poverty_above_count                         <dbl> 1667, 1519, 826, 2632, 161…\n$ household_count                             <dbl> 680, 718, 405, 905, 732, 6…\n$ average_household_size                      <dbl> 2.59, 2.62, 2.71, 2.97, 2.…\n$ median_household_income                     <dbl> 123500, 66768, 56216, 1172…\n$ households_income_below_10k                 <dbl> 18, 47, 10, 22, 6, 107, 10…\n$ households_income_10k_15k                   <dbl> 0, 0, 24, 0, 15, 231, 10, …\n$ households_income_15k_20k                   <dbl> 0, 13, 18, 0, 51, 12, 12, …\n$ households_income_20k_25k                   <dbl> 0, 12, 0, 13, 10, 12, 0, 6…\n$ households_income_25k_30k                   <dbl> 30, 74, 35, 41, 0, 9, 0, 3…\n$ households_income_30k_35k                   <dbl> 0, 10, 16, 0, 102, 47, 15,…\n$ households_income_35k_40k                   <dbl> 0, 24, 0, 0, 29, 6, 0, 0, …\n$ households_income_40k_45k                   <dbl> 19, 17, 0, 13, 21, 8, 0, 0…\n$ households_income_45k_50k                   <dbl> 15, 15, 47, 56, 91, 0, 0, …\n$ households_income_50k_60k                   <dbl> 76, 28, 90, 53, 70, 17, 18…\n$ households_income_60k_75k                   <dbl> 126, 156, 61, 140, 67, 20,…\n$ households_income_75k_100k                  <dbl> 15, 71, 74, 40, 74, 27, 11…\n$ households_income_100k_125k                 <dbl> 53, 125, 0, 77, 89, 52, 13…\n$ households_income_125k_150k                 <dbl> 101, 10, 22, 171, 89, 0, 1…\n$ households_income_150k_200k                 <dbl> 173, 30, 0, 180, 0, 0, 150…\n$ households_income_above_200k                <dbl> 54, 86, 8, 99, 18, 116, 18…\n$ households_mortgage_total                   <dbl> 251, 452, 190, 641, 248, 1…\n$ households_mortgage_over30pct               <dbl> 88, 223, 97, 195, 87, 0, 3…\n$ households_mortgage_over50pct               <dbl> 68, 38, 13, 76, 18, 0, 33,…\n$ households_no_mortgage_total                <dbl> 324, 226, 0, 110, 98, 0, 6…\n$ households_no_mortgage_over30pct            <dbl> 18, 126, 0, 0, 37, 0, 32, …\n$ households_no_mortgage_over50pct            <dbl> 18, 91, 0, 0, 21, 0, 10, 0…\n$ households_rent_total                       <dbl> 105, 40, 215, 154, 386, 65…\n$ households_rent_over30pct                   <dbl> 90, 30, 110, 0, 268, 345, …\n$ households_rent_over50pct                   <dbl> 13, 9, 64, 0, 141, 198, 0,…\n$ per_capita_income                           <dbl> 45172, 34343, 24410, 39796…\n$ geometry                                    <MULTIPOLYGON [m]> MULTIPOLYGON …\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Areal Interpolation {#sec-areal-interp}\n\n\n\n::: callout-caution\nAreal interpolation, based on area weighted averaging, is possibly most useful for estimating count data for overlapping polygons - like population size or number of households - since we generally have no other information about how population density varies within the source polygons (unless significantly more effort is invested, such as looking at aerial imagery data). \n\nHowever, for intensive variables that are associated with the estimated count data - per capita or median household income - it may be be more appropriate to use the corresponding estimated count data (rather than area) as a weighting factor. For example, for per capita income, we can use the estimated population counts to produce a population weighted average per capia income (rather than an area weighted average per capita income). \n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn addition, there may be cases where we can use more granular block-level population data from the decennial census to estimate population densities and distributions within larger census units, like block groups and tracts.  \nSee @sec-pop-weighted-interpolation for more information.\n:::\n\nThere are a couple of ways to implement the areal interpolation method. The example below uses the [`aw_interpolate`](https://chris-prener.github.io/areal/reference/aw_interpolate.html) function from the [`areal`](https://chris-prener.github.io/areal/) R package. The `sf` package's [`st_interpolate_aw`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/interpolate_aw.html) function provides similar functionality. It's also possible to 'manually' implement the process using lower level functions from the `sf` package, which can be useful for even more control, but is more complicated to implement (see @sec-manual-calcs below for examples of 'manual' calculations that demonstrate how the interpolation function works and provide a check on the results).\n\nNote that there are some settings that you may need to modify in the `aw_interpolate` function depending on the type of analysis you're doing. In particular, for more information about extensive versus intensive interpolations, see [this section of the documenation](https://chris-prener.github.io/areal/articles/areal-weighted-interpolation.html#extensive-and-intensive-interpolations). For more information about the `weight` argument -- which can be either `sum` or `total` -- see [this section of the documentation](https://chris-prener.github.io/areal/articles/areal-weighted-interpolation.html#calculating-weights-for-extensive-interpolations).\n\n::: callout-caution\nUsing interpolated results for the variables in the `intensive` list below may not be the best approach. For variables like average houshold size or per capita income, it may be more appropriate to use a separate process that first calculates relevant counts in each overlapping census unit (e.g., number of households or number of people, respectively), then weight the results using those counts (see section \\[TO BE ADDED\\] below). For median household income, it may be more appropriate to use the counts in each income bracket to estimate a median income and/or present the income distribution rather than a single value.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwater_systems_sac_demographics <- water_systems_sac %>% \n    aw_interpolate(tid = WATER_SY_1, \n                   source = census_data_filter, \n                   sid = GEOID, \n                   weight = 'total',\n                   output = 'sf', \n                   extensive = c(\n                       'population_total', \n                       'population_hispanic_or_latino',\n                       'population_white', \n                       'population_black_or_african_american',\n                       'population_native_american_or_alaska_native', \n                       'population_asian', \n                       'population_pacific_islander',\n                       'population_other_or_multiple',\n                       'poverty_total_assessed', \n                       'poverty_below_count', \n                       'poverty_above_count',\n                       'household_count', \n                       'households_income_below_10k', \n                       'households_income_10k_15k', \n                       'households_income_15k_20k', \n                       'households_income_20k_25k', \n                       'households_income_25k_30k', \n                       'households_income_30k_35k', \n                       'households_income_35k_40k', \n                       'households_income_40k_45k', \n                       'households_income_45k_50k', \n                       'households_income_50k_60k', \n                       'households_income_60k_75k', \n                       'households_income_75k_100k', \n                       'households_income_100k_125k', \n                       'households_income_125k_150k', \n                       'households_income_150k_200k', \n                       'households_income_above_200k', \n                       'households_mortgage_total', \n                       'households_mortgage_over30pct', \n                       'households_mortgage_over50pct', \n                       'households_no_mortgage_total', \n                       'households_no_mortgage_over30pct', \n                       'households_no_mortgage_over50pct', \n                       'households_rent_total', \n                       'households_rent_over30pct', \n                       'households_rent_over50pct'\n                   )#, \n                   # intensive = c(\n                   #     'median_household_income', \n                   #     'average_household_size', \n                   #     'per_capita_income'\n                   # )\n    )\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe've now got a dataset with the selected census data estimated for each of the *target* geographic features (water system service areas).

is done in @sec-results-save ). But, it may be useful to do some additional computations and re-formatting before saving the dataset. For example, in this case it may be useful to calculate the racial/ethnic breakdown of each system's population as percentages of the total population (in addition to the total counts derived above).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# We can start by renaming the fields that start with population_ and median_household_income to indicate that they are estimates.\n\n# water_systems_sac_demographics <- water_systems_sac_demographics %>%\n#     rename_with(.fn = ~ str_replace(.,\n#                                     pattern = 'population_',\n#                                     replacement = 'population_')) # %>%\n#     rename_with(.fn = ~ str_replace(., \n#                                     pattern = 'median_household_income', \n#                                     replacement = 'median_household_income'))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Then add columns with each racial/ethnic group's estimated percent of the total population within each water system's service area:\n\nwater_systems_sac_demographics <- water_systems_sac_demographics %>% \n    mutate(\n        across(\n            .cols = starts_with('population_'),\n            .fns = ~ round(.x / population_total * 100, 2),\n            .names = \"{str_replace(.col, 'population_', 'percent_')}\"\n        ), \n        .after = population_white) \n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can also calculate the estimated poverty rate for each water system's service area.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwater_systems_sac_demographics <- water_systems_sac_demographics %>% \n    mutate(poverty_rate_percent = \n               round(100 * poverty_below_count / poverty_total_assessed,\n                     2),\n           .before = poverty_above_count)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen format the data, rounding the estimated values to appropriate levels of precision:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwater_systems_sac_demographics <- water_systems_sac_demographics %>% \n    mutate(\n        across(\n            .cols = starts_with('population_'),\n            .fns = ~ round(.x, 0)\n        )) # %>% \n    # mutate(median_household_income = round(median_household_income, digits = 0))\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, just as a check, add a column (which we'll call `population_percent_difference`) to compute the difference between the estimated total population (in the `population_total` field) and the total population listed in the `POPULATION` field (the reported value from the water system dataset).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwater_systems_sac_demographics <- water_systems_sac_demographics %>% \n    mutate(population_percent_difference = \n               round((population_total -

water system dataset (e.g., the depicted boundaries may not be correct or exact, the supplier may have used different methods to count/estimate the population they serve, the time frames for the estimates may be different, etc.). But, there may also be some cases where the numbers differ significantly -- depending on the actual analysis being performed, this may mean that further work is needed for certain areas, or could mean that this method may not be sufficient and different methods are needed.\n\nFor water systems with a small population and/or service area, the estimated demographics may not match the population numbers in the original water system dataset very well. You can see this in @tbl-pop-est-small by comparing the `POPULATION` field, which contains the total population values from the water supplier dataset, with the `population_total` field, which contains the total population estimated from the census data; the difference between the two is summarized in the `population_percent_difference` field.

From the @fig-manual-zero-pop above, you can see that the service area reported for this system is very small, only covering a small fraction of a single census unit, resulting in a population estimate that is very low. In this case, it could be that the system area was drawn incorrectly (i.e., maybe it doesn't really depict the entire service area), in which case the reported service area should be revised. Or, it's possible that the population within the given census unit is very un-evenly distributed and instead there's a relatively high density population cluster in the depicted service area, in which case a more sophisticated method than an area-weighted average should be used (e.g., maybe consider the density of buildings, roads, and/or other features associated with inhabited areas).\n\n## Alternative Computation Methods\n\n::: callout-warning\nThis section is in progress...\n:::\n\n### Population Weighted Interpolation {#sec-pop-weighted-interpolation}\n\n::: callout-warning\nThis section is in progress...\n:::\n\nThis could be used for estimating certain types of metrics (e.g., median household income, CalEnviroScreen scores), using known or estimated population distributions (i.e., not used directly to determine population count in a given area).\n\nThere may be a few ways to do this:\n\n1.  'Manual' calculation -- e.g., estimate population of overlapping census units (using total population multiplied by % of the census unit within the target area), then use those derived populations as weights (rather than the area of overlap)\n2.  Use the [`interpolate_pw`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/reference/interpolate_pw.html) function from the `tidycensus` package (I think this is based on the methodology described [here](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/business-analyst/data-apportionment-and-layers.htm) but need to investigate further).\n\nAs a rough example of option #2:\n\nFirst get 2020 census population by census block (not strictly necessary, but this is the most spatially granular census population data available):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# get census data\ncensus_data_blocks <- get_decennial(geography = 'block', # can be 'block', 'block group', 'tract', 'county', etc.\n                                    state = 'CA', \n                                    county = counties_list,\n                                    year = 2020,\n                                    variables = c(\n                                        'population_total' = 'P2_001N'\n                                    ),\n                                    output = 'wide', # can be 'wide' or 'tidy'\n                                    geometry = TRUE,\n                                    cache_table = TRUE) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nGetting data from the 2020 decennial Census\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nUsing the PL 94-171 Redistricting Data Summary File\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThen interpolate:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults_interp_popwt <- interpolate_pw(from = census_data_filter %>% \n                                           st_transform(crs_projected) %>% \n                                           filter(!is.na(median_household_income)) %>% \n                                           select(median_household_income), \n                                       to = water_systems_sac %>% \n                                           st_transform(crs_projected), \n                                       to_id = 'WATER_SY_1', \n                                       extensive = FALSE, \n                                       weights = census_data_blocks %>% \n                                           st_transform(crs_projected), \n                                       # weight_placement = 'surface',\n                                       weight_column = 'population_total') %>% \n    rename(median_household_income_popwt = median_household_income) # rename results field\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults_interp_popwt <- results_interp_popwt %>% \n    left_join(water_systems_sac %>% \n                  st_drop_geometry() %>% \n                  select(SERVICE_CO, POPULATION, WATER_SY_1), \n              by = 'WATER_SY_1')\n\nglimpse(results_interp_popwt)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 62\nColumns: 5\n$ WATER_SY_1                    <chr> \"HOOD WATER MAINTENCE DIST [SWS]\", \"MC C…\n$ median_household_income_popwt <dbl> 56250.00, 60521.00, 68248.00, NA, 29468.…\n$ SERVICE_CO                    <dbl> 82, 199, 34, 64, 128, 83, 28, 50, 164, 5…\n$ POPULATION                    <dbl> 100, 700, 40, 150, 256, 150, 32, 100, 35…\n$ geometry                      <MULTIPOLYGON [m]> MULTIPOLYGON (((-132703 403…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that not all water systems get an estimated value using this method (even if `NA` values are removed from the source data) -- a total of 17 systems are missing results with this method, which tend to be the smallest water systems.\n\n\n## Working with Other (Non-Census) Source Data\n\n::: callout-warning\nThis section is in progress...\n:::\n\n### CalEnviroScreen\n\n::: callout-warning\nThis section is in progress...\n:::\n",
